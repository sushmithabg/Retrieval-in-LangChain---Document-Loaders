       "[Document(page_content='A Day of Very Low Probability\\n\\nBeneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line…\\n\\n(black robes, falling)\\n\\n…blood spills out in litres, and someone screams a word.\\n\\nEvery inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each bookcase has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, history, and everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that you can see the back layer of books above the books in front. And it still isn’t enough. Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little heaps under the windows.\\n\\nThis is the living-room of the house occupied by the eminent Professor Michael Verres-Evans, and his wife, Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres, and their adopted son, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.\\n\\nThere is a letter lying on the living-room table, and an unstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to Mr. H. Potter in emerald-green ink.\\n\\nThe Professor and his wife are speaking sharply at each other, but they are not shouting. The Professor considers shouting to be uncivilised.\\n\\n“You’re joking,” Michael said to Petunia. His tone indicated that he was very much afraid that she was serious.\\n\\n“My sister was a witch,” Petunia repeated. She looked frightened, but stood her ground. “Her husband was a wizard.”\\n\\n“This is absurd!” Michael said sharply. “They were at our wedding—they visited for Christmas—”\\n\\n“I told them you weren’t to know,” Petunia whispered. “But it’s true. I’ve seen things—”\\n\\nThe Professor rolled his eyes. “Dear, I understand that you’re not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible. Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they could always guess what you were thinking, that’s called cold reading—”\\n\\n“It wasn’t bending spoons—”\\n\\n“What was it, then?”\\n\\nPetunia bit her lip. “I can’t just tell you. You’ll think I’m—” She swallowed. “Listen. Michael. I wasn’t—always like this—” She gestured at herself, as though to indicate her lithe form. “Lily did this. Because I—because I begged her. For years, I begged her. Lily had always been prettier than me, and I’d… been mean to her, because of that, and then she got magic, can you imagine how I felt? And I begged her to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too, even if I couldn’t have her magic, at least I could be pretty.”\\n\\nTears were gathering in Petunia’s eyes.\\n\\n“And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister, or a centaur told her not to—the most ridiculous things, and I hated her for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I was going out with this boy, Vernon Dursley, he was fat and he was the only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children, and that his first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to myself, what kind of parent names their child Dudley Dursley? It was like I saw my whole future life stretching out in front of me, and I couldn’t stand it. And I wrote to my sister and told her that if she didn’t help me I’d rather just—”\\n\\nPetunia stopped.\\n\\n“Anyway,” Petunia said, her voice small, “she gave in. She told me it was dangerous, and I said I didn’t care any more, and I drank this potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin cleared up and I finally filled out and… I was beautiful, people were nice to me,” her voice broke, “and after that I couldn’t hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what her magic brought her in the end—”\\n\\n“Darling,” Michael said gently, “you got sick, you gained some weight while resting in bed, and your skin cleared up on its own. Or being sick made you change your diet—”\\n\\n“She was a witch,” Petunia repeated. “I saw it.”\\n\\n“Petunia,” Michael said. The annoyance was creeping into his voice. “You know that can’t be true. Do I really have to explain why?”\\n\\nPetunia wrung her hands. She seemed to be on the verge of tears. “My love, I know I can’t win arguments with you, but please, you have to trust me on this—”\\n\\n“Dad! Mum!”\\n\\nThe two of them stopped and looked at Harry as though they’d forgotten there was a third person in the room.\\n\\nHarry took a deep breath. “Mum, your parents didn’t have magic, did they?”\\n\\n“No,” Petunia said, looking puzzled.\\n\\n“Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her letter. How did they get convinced?”\\n\\n“Ah…” Petunia said. “They didn’t just send a letter. They sent a professor from Hogwarts. He—” Petunia’s eyes flicked to Michael. “He showed us some magic.”\\n\\n“Then you don’t have to fight over this,” Harry said firmly. Hoping against hope that this time, just this once, they would listen to him. “If it’s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it’s true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it’s false. That’s what the experimental method is for, so that we don’t have to resolve things just by arguing.”\\n\\nThe Professor turned and looked down at him, dismissive as usual. “Oh, come now, Harry. Really, magic? I thought you’d know better than to take this seriously, son, even if you’re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing there is!”\\n\\nHarry’s mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry had been sent to the best primary schools—and when that didn’t work out, he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of starving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study whatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he entered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except, maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of course; that’s what a Good Parent would do, and so, if you conceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But take a ten-year-old seriously? Hardly.\\n\\nSometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father.\\n\\n“Mum,” Harry said. “If you want to win this argument with Dad, look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. There’s a quote there about how philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong, because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is observation—that you just have to look at the world and report what you see. Um… off the top of my head I can’t think of where to find something about how it’s an ideal of science to settle things by experiment instead of arguments—”\\n\\nHis mother looked down at him and smiled. “Thank you, Harry. But—” her head rose back up to stare at her husband. “I don’t want to win an argument with your father. I want my husband to, to listen to his wife who loves him, and trust her just this once—”\\n\\nHarry closed his eyes briefly. Hopeless. Both of his parents were just hopeless.\\n\\nNow his parents were getting into one of those arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel guilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.\\n\\n“I’m going to go to my room,” Harry announced. His voice trembled a little. “Please try not to fight too much about this, Mum, Dad, we’ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?”\\n\\n“Of course, Harry,” said his father, and his mother gave him a reassuring kiss, and then they went on fighting while Harry climbed the stairs to his bedroom.\\n\\nHe shut the door behind him and tried to think.\\n\\nThe funny thing was, he should have agreed with Dad. No one had ever seen any evidence of magic, and according to Mum, there was a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep something like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather suspicious sort of excuse.\\n\\nIt should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being insane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without a stamp. A little insanity was far, far less improbable than the universe really working like that.\\n\\nExcept that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic was real, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\\n\\nHarry rubbed his forehead, grimacing. Don’t believe everything you think, one of his books had said.\\n\\nBut this bizarre certainty… Harry was finding himself just expecting that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up and wave a wand and magic would come out. The strange certainty was making no effort to guard itself against falsification—wasn’t making excuses in advance for why there wouldn’t be a professor, or the professor would only be able to bend spoons.\\n\\nWhere do you come from, strange little prediction? Harry directed the thought at his brain. Why do I believe what I believe?\\n\\nUsually Harry was pretty good at answering that question, but in this particular case, he had no clue what his brain was thinking.\\n\\nHarry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords pushing, and a handle on a door affords pulling, and the thing to do with a testable hypothesis is to go and test it.\\n\\nHe took a piece of lined paper from his desk, and started writing.\\n\\nDear Deputy Headmistress\\n\\nHarry paused, reflecting; then discarded the paper for another, tapping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil. This called for careful calligraphy.\\n\\nDear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall,\\n\\nOr Whomsoever It May Concern:\\n\\nI recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts, addressed to Mr. H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic parents, James Potter and Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) are dead. I was adopted by Lily’s sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, and her husband, Michael Verres-Evans.\\n\\nI am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts, conditional on such a place actually existing. Only my mother Petunia says she knows about magic, and she can’t use it herself. My father is highly sceptical. I myself am uncertain. I also don’t know where to obtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance letter.\\n\\nMother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to Lily Potter (then Lily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family that magic was real, and, I presume, help Lily obtain her school materials. If you could do this for my own family it would be extremely helpful.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nHarry James Potter-Evans-Verres.\\n\\nHarry added their current address, then folded up the letter and put it in an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further consideration led him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap of the envelope, into which, using a penknife’s tip, he impressed the initials H.J.P.E.V. If he was going to descend into this madness, he was going to do it with style.\\n\\nThen he opened his door and went back downstairs. His father was sitting in the living-room and reading a book of higher maths to show how smart he was; and his mother was in the kitchen preparing one of his father’s favourite meals to show how loving she was. It didn’t look like they were talking to one another at all. As scary as arguments could be, not arguing was somehow much worse.\\n\\n“Mum,” Harry said into the unnerving silence, “I’m going to test the hypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to Hogwarts?”\\n\\nHis mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, looking shocked. “I—I don’t know, I think you just have to own a magic owl.”\\n\\nThat should’ve sounded highly suspicious, oh, so there’s no way to test your theory then, but the peculiar certainty in Harry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further.\\n\\n“Well, the letter got here somehow,” Harry said, “so I’ll just wave it around outside and call ‘letter for Hogwarts!’ and see if an owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come and watch?”\\n\\nHis father shook his head minutely and kept on reading. Of course, Harry thought to himself. Magic was a disgraceful thing that only stupid people believed in; if his father went so far as to test the hypothesis, or even watch it being tested, that would feel like associating himself with that…\\n\\nOnly as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden, did it occur to him that if an owl did come down and snatch the letter, he was going to have some trouble telling Dad about it.\\n\\nBut—well—that can’t really happen, can it? No matter what my brain seems to believe. If an owl really comes down and grabs this envelope, I’m going to have worries a lot more important than what Dad thinks.\\n\\nHarry took a deep breath, and raised the envelope into the air.\\n\\nHe swallowed.\\n\\nCalling out Letter for Hogwarts! while holding an envelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden was… actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about it.\\n\\nNo. I’m better than Dad. I will use the scientific method even if it makes me feel stupid.\\n\\n“Letter—” Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a whispered croak.\\n\\nHarry steeled his will, and shouted into the empty sky, “Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?”\\n\\n“Harry?” asked a bemused woman’s voice, one of the neighbours.\\n\\nHarry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the envelope behind his back like it was drug money. His whole face was hot with shame.\\n\\nAn old woman’s face peered out from above the neighbouring fence, grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the occasional babysitter. “What are you doing, Harry?”\\n\\n“Nothing,” Harry said in a strangled voice. “Just—testing a really silly theory—”\\n\\n“Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?”\\n\\nHarry froze in place.\\n\\n“Yes,” Harry’s lips said a little while later. “I got a letter from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but—”\\n\\n“But you don’t have an owl. Poor dear! I can’t imagine what someone must have been thinking, sending you just the standard letter.”\\n\\nA wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, and opened an expectant hand. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over his envelope.\\n\\n“Just leave it to me, dear,” said Mrs. Figg, “and in a jiffy or two I’ll have someone over.”\\n\\nAnd her face disappeared from over the fence.\\n\\nThere was a long silence in the garden.\\n\\nThen a boy’s voice said, calmly and quietly, “What.”', metadata={'source': 'HP_data/harry_potter_html/001.html'})]"

I also don’t know where to obtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance letter.\\n\\nMother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to Lily Potter (then Lily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family that magic was real, and, I presume, help Lily obtain her school materials. If you could do this for my own family it would be extremely helpful.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nHarry James Potter-Evans-Verres.\\n\\nHarry added their current address, then folded up the letter and put it in an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further consideration led him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap of the envelope, into which, using a penknife’s tip, he impressed the initials H.J.P.E.V. If he was going to descend into this madness, he was going to do it with style.\\n\\nThen he opened his door and went back downstairs. His father was sitting in the living-room and reading a book of higher maths to show how smart he was; and his mother was in the kitchen preparing one of his father’s favourite meals to show how loving she was. It didn’t look like they were talking to one another at all. As scary as arguments could be, not arguing was somehow much worse.\\n\\n“Mum,” Harry said into the unnerving silence, “I’m going to test the hypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to Hogwarts?”\\n\\nHis mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, looking shocked. “I—I don’t know, I think you just have to own a magic owl.”\\n\\nThat should’ve sounded highly suspicious, oh, so there’s no way to test your theory then, but the peculiar certainty in Harry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further.\\n\\n“Well, the letter got here somehow,” Harry said, “so I’ll just wave it around outside and call ‘letter for Hogwarts!’ and see if an owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come and watch?”\\n\\nHis father shook his head minutely and kept on reading. Of course, Harry thought to himself. Magic was a disgraceful thing that only stupid people believed in; if his father went so far as to test the hypothesis, or even watch it being tested, that would feel like associating himself with that…\\n\\nOnly as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden, did it occur to him that if an owl did come down and snatch the letter, he was going to have some trouble telling Dad about it.\\n\\nBut—well—that can’t really happen, can it? No matter what my brain seems to believe. If an owl really comes down and grabs this envelope, I’m going to have worries a lot more important than what Dad thinks.\\n\\nHarry took a deep breath, and raised the envelope into the air.\\n\\nHe swallowed.\\n\\nCalling out Letter for Hogwarts! while holding an envelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden was… actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about it.\\n\\nNo. I’m better than Dad. I will use the scientific method even if it makes me feel stupid.\\n\\n“Letter—” Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a whispered croak.\\n\\nHarry steeled his will, and shouted into the empty sky, “Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?”\\n\\n“Harry?” asked a bemused woman’s voice, one of the neighbours.\\n\\nHarry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the envelope behind his back like it was drug money. His whole face was hot with shame.\\n\\nAn old woman’s face peered out from above the neighbouring fence, grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the occasional babysitter. “What are you doing, Harry?”\\n\\n“Nothing,” Harry said in a strangled voice. “Just—testing a really silly theory—”\\n\\n“Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?”\\n\\nHarry froze in place.\\n\\n“Yes,” Harry’s lips said a little while later. “I got a letter from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but—”\\n\\n“But you don’t have an owl. Poor dear! I can’t imagine what someone must have been thinking, sending you just the standard letter.”\\n\\nA wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, and opened an expectant hand. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over his envelope.\\n\\n“Just leave it to me, dear,” said Mrs. Figg, “and in a jiffy or two I’ll have someone over.”\\n\\nAnd her face disappeared from over the fence.\\n\\nThere was a long silence in the garden.\\n\\nThen a boy’s voice said, calmly and quietly, “What.”' metadata={'source': 'HP_data/harry_potter_html/001.html'}\n"

And it still isn’t enough.\\nBooks are overﬂowing onto the tables and the sofas and making\\nlittle heaps under the windows.\\nThis is the living-room of the house occupied by the eminent\\nProfessor Michael Verres-Evans, and his wife, Mrs. Petunia Evans-\\nVerres, and their adopted son, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.\\nThere is a letter lying on the living-room table, and an un-\\nstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to Mr. H.\\nPotter in emerald-green ink.\\nThe Professor and his wife are speaking sharply at each other,\\nbut they are not shouting.

His tone indicated\\nthat he was very much afraid that she was serious.\\n“My sister was a witch,” Petunia repeated. She looked fright-\\nened, but stood her ground. “Her husband was a wizard.”\\n“This is absurd!” Michael said sharply. “They were at our\\nwedding—they visited for Christmas—”\\n“I told them you weren’t to know,” Petunia whispered. “But\\nit’s true.

For years, I begged her.

And when I had just graduated from university, I was\\ngoing out with this boy, Vernon Dursley, he was fat and he was the\\nonly boy who would talk to me.

He was treated well, probably\\nbetter than most genetic fathers treated their own children.

Always Harry had been encouraged to study\\nwhatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his\\nfancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he en-\\ntered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except,\\nmaybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching biochem-\\nistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the advice of a\\nlittle boy.

Like, you live in a city\\nwhere there are a million people, and there’s a murder, and a de-\\ntective says, well, we’ve got no evidence at all, so have we consid-\\nered the possibility that Mortimer Snodgrass did it?”\\n“Did he?” said Dumbledore.\\n“No,” said Harry. “But later it turns out that the murderer had\\nblack hair, and Mortimer has black hair, so everyone’s like, ah,\\nlooks like Mortimer did it after all. So it’s unfair to Mortimer for\\nthe police to promote him to their attention without having good rea-\\nsons already in hand to suspect him. When there are lots of possi-\\nbilities, most of the work goes into just locating the true answer—\\nstarting to pay attention to it. You don’t need proof, or the sort of\\nofﬁcial evidence that scientists or courts demand, but you need\\nsome sort of hint, and that hint has to discriminate that particular\\npossibility from the millions of others. Otherwise you can’t just\\npluck the right answer out of thin air. You can’t even pluck a pos-\\nsibility worth thinking about out of thin air. And there’s got to be\\na million other things I could do besides carrying around my fa-\\nther’s rock.

All right. My\\nown experiment was a failure, Draco. There’s something called\\nthe Interdict of Merlin—”\\nDraco hit himself on the forehead, realizing.\\n“—which stops anyone from getting knowledge of powerful\\nspells out of books, even if you ﬁnd and read a powerful wizard’s\\nnotes they won’t make sense to you, it has to go from one living\\nmind to another. I couldn’t ﬁnd any powerful spells that we had\\nthe instructions for but couldn’t cast. But if you can’t get them out\\nof old books, why would anyone bother passing them on by word\\nof mouth after they stopped working? Did you get the data on the\\nSquib couples?”\\nDraco started to hand the parchment over—\\nBut Harry Potter held up a hand. “Law of science, Draco. First\\nI tell you the theory and the prediction. Then you show me the\\ndata. That way you know I’m not just making up a theory to ﬁt;\\nyou know that the theory actually predicted the data in advance. I\\nhave to explain this to you anyway, so I have to explain it before\\nyou show me the data. That’s the rule. So put on your cloak and\\nlet’s sit down.”\\nHarry Potter sat down at a desk with torn scraps of paper ar-\\nranged across its surface. Draco drew his cloak out of his bookbag,\\ndrew it on, and sat down across from Harry on the other side, giv-\\ning the paper scraps a puzzled look. They were arranged in two\\nrows and the rows were about twenty scraps long.\\n“The secret of blood,” said Harry Potter, an intense look on his\\nface, “is something called deoxyribose nucleic acid. You don’t say\\nthat name in front of anyone who’s not a scientist. Deoxyribose nu-\\ncleic acid is the recipe that tells your body how to grow, two legs,\\ntwo arms, short or tall, whether you have brown eyes or green. It’s\\na material thing, you can seeit if you have microscopes, which are\\nlike telescopes only they look at things that are very small instead\\nof very far away. And that recipe has two copies of everything, al-\\nways, in case one copy is broken. Imagine two long rows of pieces\\nof paper. At each place in the row, there are two pieces of paper,\\nand when you have children, your body selects one piece of paper\\nat random from each place in the row, and the mother’s body will\\ndo the same, and so the child also gets two pieces of paper at each\\nplace in the row. Two copies of everything, one from your mother,\\none from your father, and when you have children they get one\\npiece of paper from you at random in each place.”\\nAs Harry spoke, his ﬁngers ranged over the paired scraps of\\npaper, pointing to one part of the pair when he said “from your\\n326', metadata={'source': 'HP_data/harry_potter_pdf/hpmor-trade-classic.pdf', 'page': 335}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='mother”, the other when he said “from your father”. And as\\nHarry talked about picking a piece of paper at random, his hand\\npulled a Knut out of his robes and ﬂipped it; Harry looked at the\\ncoin, and then pointed to the top piece of paper. All without a\\npause in the speech.\\n“Now when it comes to something like being short or tall,\\nthere’s a lotof places in the recipe that make little differences. So\\nif a tall father marries a short mother, the child gets some pieces\\nof paper saying ‘tall’ and some pieces of paper saying ‘short’, and\\nusually the child ends up middle-sized. But not always. By luck,\\nthe child might get a lot of pieces saying ‘tall’, and not many pa-\\npers saying ‘short’, and grow up pretty tall. You could have a tall\\nfather with ﬁve papers saying ‘tall’ and a tall mother with ﬁve pa-\\npers saying ‘tall’ and by amazing luck the child gets all ten papers\\nsaying ‘tall’ and ends up taller than both of them. You see? Blood\\nisn’t a perfect ﬂuid, it doesn’t mix perfectly. Deoxyribose nucleic\\nacid is made up of lots of little pieces, like a glass of pebbles in-\\nstead of a glass of water. That’s why a child isn’t always exactly in\\nthe middle of the parents.”\\nDraco listened with his mouth open. How in Merlin’s name\\nhad the Muggles ﬁgured all this out? They could seethe recipe?\\n“Now,” Harry Potter said, “suppose that, just like with tall-\\nness, there’s lots of little places in the recipe where you can have a\\npiece of paper that says ‘magic’ or ‘not magic’. If you have enough\\npieces of paper saying ‘magic’ you’re a wizard, if you have a lot\\nof pieces of paper you’re a powerful wizard, if you have too few\\nyou’re a Muggle, and in between you’re a Squib. Then, when two\\nSquibs marry, most of the time the children should also be Squibs,\\nbut once in a while a child will get lucky and get most of the fa-\\nther’s magic papers andmost of the mother’s magic papers, and\\nbe strong enough to be a wizard. But probably not a very power-\\nful one. If you started out with a lot of powerful wizards and they\\nmarried only each other, they would stay powerful. But if they\\nstarted marrying Muggleborns who were just barely magical, or\\nSquibs. . . you see? The blood wouldn’t mix perfectly, it would be\\na glass of pebbles, not a glass of water, because that’s just the way\\nblood works. There would still be powerful wizards now and then,\\nwhen they got a lot of magic papers by luck. But they wouldn’t be\\nas powerful as the most powerful wizards from earlier.”\\nDraco nodded slowly. He’d never heard it explained that way\\nbefore. There was a surprising beauty to how exactly it ﬁt.\\n*“But,*” Harry said. “That’s only onehypothesis. Suppose that\\ninstead there’s only a single place in the recipe that makes you a\\nwizard. Only oneplace where a piece of paper can say ‘magic’ or\\n‘not magic’. And there are two copies of everything, always. So\\nthen there are only three possibilities. Both copies can say ‘magic’.\\n327', metadata={'source': 'HP_data/harry_potter_pdf/hpmor-trade-classic.pdf', 'page': 336}),\n",

Wizards, Squibs, and Muggles.\\nMuggleborns wouldn’t really be born to Muggles, they would be\\nborn to two Squibs, two parents each with one magic copy who’d\\ngrown up in the Muggle world. Now imagine a witch marries\\na Squib. Each child will get one paper saying ‘magic’ from the\\nmother, always, it doesn’t matter which piece gets picked at ran-\\ndom, both say ‘magic’. But like ﬂipping a coin, half the time the\\nchild will get a paper saying ‘magic’ from the father, and half the\\ntime the child will get the father’s paper saying ‘not magic’. When\\na witch marries a Squib, the result won’t be a lot of weak wizard-\\ning children. Half the children will be wizards and witches just\\nas powerful as their mother, and half the children will be Squibs.\\nBecause if there’s just oneplace in the recipe that makes you a wiz-\\nard, then magic isn’t like a glass of pebbles that can mix. It’s like a\\nsingle magical pebble, a sorcerer’s stone.”\\nHarry arranged three pairs of papers side by side. On one pair\\nhe wrote ‘magic’ and ‘magic’. On another pair he wrote ‘magic’ on\\nthe top paper only. And the third pair he left blank.\\n“In which case,” Harry said, “either you have two stones or\\nyou don’t. Either you’re a wizard or not. Powerful wizards would\\nget that way by studying harder and practicing more. And if wiz-\\nards get inherently less powerful, not because of spells being lost\\nbut because people can’t cast them. . . then maybe they’re eating\\nthe wrong foods or something. But if it’s gotten steadily worse\\nover eight hundred years, then that could mean magic itself is fad-\\ning out of the world.”\\nHarry arranged another two pairs of papers side by side, and\\ntook out a quill. Soon each pair had one piece of paper saying\\n‘magic’ and the other paper blank.\\n“And that brings me to the prediction,” said Harry. “What hap-\\npens when two Squibs marry. Flip a coin twice. It can come up\\nheads and heads, heads and tails, tails and heads, or tails and tails.\\nSo one quarter of the time you’ll get two heads, one quarter of the\\ntime you’ll get two tails, and half the time you’ll get one heads\\nand one tail. Same thing if two Squibs marry. One quarter of the\\nchildren would come up magic and magic, and be wizards. One\\nquarter would come up not-magic and not-magic, and be Mug-\\ngles. The other half would be Squibs. It’s a very old and very clas-\\nsic pattern. It was discovered by Gregor Mendel who is not for-\\ngotten, and it was the ﬁrst hint ever uncovered for how the recipe\\nworked. Anyone who knows anything about blood science would\\nrecognise that pattern in an instant. It wouldn’t be exact, any more\\nthan if you ﬂip a coin twice forty times you’ll always get exactly\\nten pairs of two heads.

But it all had to happen incrementally —\\nevolution never looked ahead, evolution would never start pro-\\nmoting B in preparation for A becoming universal later. Evolution\\nwas the simple historical fact that, whichever organisms did in\\nfact have the most children, their genes would in fact be more fre-\\nquent in the next generation. So each piece of a complex machine\\nhad to become nearly universal before other pieces in the machine\\nwould evolve to depend on its presence.\\nSocomplex, interdependent machinery, the powerful sophis-\\nticated protein machines that drove life, was always universal\\nwithin a sexually reproducing species—except for a small hand-\\nful of non-interdependent variants that were being selected on at\\nany given time, as further complexity was slowly laid down. It\\nwas why all human beings had the same underlying brain design,\\nthe same emotions, the same facial expressions wired up to those\\nemotions; those adaptations were complex, so they hadto be uni-\\nversal.\\nIf magic had been like that, a big complex adaptation with lots\\nof necessary genes, then a wizard mating with a Muggle would\\nhave resulted in a child with only half those parts and half the ma-\\nchine wouldn’t do much.

Harry had wondered if knowing lots of cognitive science\\ncould make him an incredibly powerful Legilimens, but repeated\\nexperience had ﬁnally driven into him the lesson that he needed\\nto get a little less excited in his anticipations about this sort of\\nthing. It wasn’t as if any cognitive scientist understood humans\\nwell enough to make one.\\nTo learn the counter, Occlumency, the ﬁrst step was to imag-\\nine yourself to be a different person, pretending it as thoroughly\\nas you could, immersing yourself entirely in that alternate per-\\nsona. You wouldn’t always have to do that, but in the beginning, it\\nwas how you learned where your surfaces were. The Legilimens\\nwould try to read you, and you would feel it happening if you\\npaid close enough attention, you would sense them trying to en-\\nter. And your job was to make sure that they always touched your\\nimaginary persona and not the real one.\\nWhen you were good enough at that, you could imagine being\\na very simple sort of person, pretend to be a rock, and make a habit\\nof leaving the pretense in place where all your surfaces were. That\\nwas a standard Occlumency barrier. Pretending to be a rock was\\nhard to learn, but easy to do afterward, and the exposed surface\\nof a mind was much shallower than its interior, so with enough\\npractice you could keep it up as a background habit.\\nOr if you were a perfect Occlumens , you could race ahead of any\\nprobes, answering queries as fast as they were asked, so that the\\nLegilimens would enter through your surfaces and see a mind in-\\ndistinguishable from whoever you were pretending to be.\\nEven the best Legilimens could be fooled that way.

The best social manipulator on Earth might not\\nknow what neurons were, and neither might the best Legilimens.\\nAnything a Legilimens could understand , an Occlumens could\\npretend to be.

The young girl’s voice sounded\\na little acerbic as her gaze scanned the bookshelves of the Herbol-\\nogy stacks in the Hogwarts library. Harry had left her a message\\nasking if she could come to the library after she’d ﬁnished break-\\nfast, which Harry had skipped; but then when Harry had intro-\\nduced the day’s topic she’d seemed a bit nonplussed. “You know\\nyour problem, Harry?

And that if I\\nwas going to be a follower of a Dark Wizard, then he wasn’t sure\\nhe wanted to be in my army anymore.”\\nHarry’s hands had stopped turning pages. It seemed that\\nHarry’s brain, for all its abstract knowledge, was still incapable of\\nappreciating scope on any real emotional level, because it had just\\nforcibly redirected his attention away from trillions of possibly-\\nsentient blades of grass who might be suffering or dying even as\\nthey spoke, and toward the life of a single human being who hap-\\npened to be nearer and dearer.\\n“Ron is the world’s most gigantic prat,” Harry said. “They\\nwon’t be printing that in the newspaper anytime soon, because\\nit’s not news.

Our current Headmaster needs merely provide some\\nnew item of evidence signiﬁcant enough to reconvene the case;\\nand with Dumbledore applying pressure instead of Dippet, the\\nresult is a foregone conclusion. Lucius Malfoy has no particular\\nreason to fear Mr. Hagrid’s vindication; thus Lucius Malfoy will\\nonly resist to the extent that he can do so costlessly in order to im-\\npose costs on Dumbledore, and Dumbledore is clearly willing to\\nprosecute the case regardless.”\\nProfessor Quirrell took a sip of his water. “But I digress. The\\nnew evidence that the Headmaster promises to provide is to ex-\\nhibit a previously undetected spell on the Sorting Hat, which,\\nthe Headmaster asserts, he has personally determined to respond\\nonly to Slytherins who are also Parselmouths. The Headmaster\\nfurther argues that this favours the interpretation that the Cham-\\nber of Secrets was indeed opened in 1943, approximately the right\\ntime frame for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, a known Parsel-\\nmouth, to have attended Hogwarts. It is a rather questionable\\nlogic, but a judicial panel may rule that it swings the case far\\nenough to bring Mr. Hagrid’s guilt into doubt, if they can man-\\nage to keep a straight face as they say it. And now we come to the\\nkey question: howdid the Headmaster discover this hidden spell\\non the Sorting Hat?”\\nProfessor Quirrell was smiling thinly now. “Well now, let us\\nsuppose that there was a Parselmouth in this year’s crop of stu-\\ndents, a potential Heir of Slytherin. You must admit, Mr. Potter,\\nthat you stand out as a possibility whenever extraordinary peo-\\nple are considered. And if I then further ask myself which new\\nSlytherin would be most likely to have his mental privacy invaded\\nby the Headmaster, speciﬁcally hunting the memories of his Sort-\\ning, why, you stand out even more.” The smile vanished. “So you\\nsee, Mr. Potter, it was not Iwho invaded your mind, though I will\\nnot ask you to apologise. It is not your fault that you believed\\nDumbledore’s protestations of respecting your mental privacy.”\\n“My sincere apologies,” Harry said, keeping his face expres-\\nsionless. The rigid control was a confession in its own right, as was\\nthe sweat beading his forehead; but he didn’t think the defence\\nProfessor would take any evidence from that.

Any progress on ﬁnding the Chamber of Se-\\ncrets?”\\nNo,thought Harry. But to maintain plausible deniability, you\\nneeded a general policy of sometimes evading questions even\\nwhen you had nothing to hide. . . “With respect, Professor Quir-\\nrell, if I had made such progress, it is not quite obvious to me that\\nI should tell you about it.”\\nProfessor Quirrell sipped from his own waterglass again.\\n“Well then, Mr. Potter, I shall freely tell you what I know or sus-\\npect. First, I believe the Chamber of Secrets is real, as is Slytherin’s\\nMonster. Miss Myrtle’s death was not discovered until hours after\\nher demise, even though the wards should have alerted the Head-\\nmaster instantly. Therefore her murder was performed either by\\nHeadmaster Dippet, which is unlikely, or by some entity which\\nSalazar Slytherin keyed into his wards at a higher level than the\\nHeadmaster himself. Second, I suspect that contrary to popular\\nlegend, the purpose of Slytherin’s Monster was notto rid Hog-\\nwarts of Muggleborns. Unless Slytherin’s Monster were powerful\\nenough to defeat the Headmaster of Hogwarts and all the teachers,\\nit could not triumph by force. Multiple murders in secrecy would\\nresult in the school’s closure, as nearly happened in 1943, or in\\nthe placing of new wards. So why Slytherin’s Monster, Mr. Potter?\\nWhat true purpose does it serve?”\\n“Ah. . . ” Harry dropped his gaze to his waterglass and tried\\nto think. “To kill anyone who got into the Chamber and didn’t\\nbelong there—”\\n“A monster powerful enough to defeat a team of wizards that\\nhad broken past the best wards Salazar could place on his Cham-\\nber? Unlikely.”\\nHarry was feeling a bit pressured now. “Well, it’s called the\\nChamber of Secrets, so maybe the Monster has a secret, or isa se-\\ncret?” For that matter, just what sort of secrets were in the Cham-\\nber of Secrets in the ﬁrst place? Harry hadn’t done a lot of research\\non the subject, in part because he’d gotten the impression that no-\\nbody knew anything—\\nProfessor Quirrell was smiling. “Why not just write the secret\\ndown?”\\n“Ahhh. . . ” said Harry. “Because if the Monster spoke Parsel-\\ntongue, that would ensure that only a true descendant of Slytherin\\ncould hear the secret?”\\n“Easy enough to key the wards on the Chamber to a phrase\\nspoken in Parseltongue.

R. R.\\nTolkien.”\\n“You recognised a quote from that book,” said Dumbledore,\\nan intent look in his eyes, “so I assume you remember it well. If I\\nam mistaken, let me be corrected.”\\nHarry just stared at him.\\n“It is important to understand,” said Dumbledore, “that this\\nbook is not a realistic depiction of a wizarding war. John Tolkien\\nnever fought Voldemort. Your war will not be like the books you\\nhave read. Real life is not like stories. Do you understand, Harry?”\\nHarry, rather slowly, nodded yes; and then shook his head no.\\n“In particular,” said Dumbledore, “there is a certain very fool-\\nish thing that Gandalf does in the ﬁrst book. He makes many\\nmistakes, does Tolkien’s wizard; but this one error is the most\\nunforgivable. That mistake is this: When Gandalf ﬁrst suspected,\\neven for a moment, that Frodo held the One Ring, he should have\\nmoved Frodo to Rivendell at once. He might have been embar-\\nrassed, that old wizard, if his suspicions had proven false. He\\nmight have found it awkward to so command Frodo, and Frodo\\nwould have been greatly inconvenienced, needing to set aside\\nmany other plans and pastimes. But a little embarrassment, and\\nawkwardness, and inconvenience, is as nothing compared to the\\nloss of your whole war, when the nine Nazgul swoop down on\\nthe Shire while you are reading old scrolls in Minas Tirith, and\\ntake the Ring at once. And it is not Frodo alone who would have\\nbeen hurt; all Middle-Earth would have fallen into slavery. If it\\nhad notbeen only a story, Harry, they would have lost their war.\\nDo you understand what I am saying?”\\n“Er. . . ” said Harry, “not exactly. . . ” There was something\\nabout Dumbledore when he was like this, which made it hard to\\nstay properly cold; his dark side had trouble with weird.\\n“Then I will spell it out,” said the old wizard. His voice was\\nstern, his eyes were sad. “Frodo should have been moved to Riven-\\ndell at once by Gandalf himself—and Frodo should never have left\\nRivendell without guard. There should have been no night of ter-\\nror in Bree, no Barrow-downs, no Weathertop where Frodo was\\nwounded, they could have lost their entire war any of those times,\\nfor Gandalf’s folly! Do you understand now what I am saying to\\nyou, son of Michael and Petunia?”\\nAnd the Harry who knew nothing did understand.\\nAnd the Harry who knew nothing saw that it was the smart,\\nthe wise, the intelligent and sane, the right thing to do.\\n817', metadata={'source': 'HP_data/harry_potter_pdf/hpmor-trade-classic.pdf', 'page': 826}),\n",

But you are not going home for Easter,\\nHarry. You are not going home for the summer. You are no longer\\ntaking lunches in Diagon Alley, even with Professor Quirrell to\\nwatch you. Your blood is the second requisite Voldemort needs to\\nrise as strong as before. So you are never again leaving the bounds\\nof Hogwarts’s wards without a vital reason, and a guard strong\\nenough to fend off any attack for long enough to get you to safety.”\\nWater was beginning at the corners of Harry’s eyes. “Is that a\\nrequest?” said his quavering voice. “Or an order?”\\n“I’m sorry, Harry,” the old wizard said softly. “Your parents\\nwill see the necessity, I hope; but if not. . . I am afraid they have\\nno recourse; the law, however wrongly, does not recognise them\\nas your guardians. I am sorry, Harry, and I will understand if you\\ndespise me for it, but it must be done.”\\nHarry whirled, looked at the door, he couldn’t look at Dumb-\\nledore any more, couldn’t trust his own face.\\nThis is the cost to yourself, said Hufﬂepuff within his mind, even\\nas you imposed costs on others. Will that change your whole view of the\\nmatter, the way Professor Quirrell thinks it will?\\nAutomatically, the mask of the innocent Harry said exactly\\nwhat it would have said: “Are my parents in danger? Do theyneed\\nto be moved here?”\\n“No,” said the old wizard’s voice. “I do not think so. The Death\\nEaters learned, toward the end of the war, not to attack the Order’s\\nfamilies. And if Voldemort is now acting without his former com-\\npanions, he still knows that it is I who make the decisions for now,\\nand he knows that I would give him nothing for any threat to your\\nfamily. I have taught him that I do not give in to blackmail, and so\\nhe will not try.”\\nHarry turned back then, and saw a coldness on the old wiz-\\nard’s face to match the shift in his voice, Dumbledore’s blue eyes\\ngrown hard as steel behind the glasses, it didn’t match the person\\nbut it matched the formal black robes.\\n“Is that everything, then?” said Harry’s trembling voice. Later\\nhe would think about this, later he would think of some cunning\\ncountermeasure, later he would ask Professor Quirrell if there was\\nany way to convince the Headmaster he was mistaken.

In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.\\nDuring the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951, India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class. India has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality. India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century. Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition, and rising levels of air pollution. India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots. Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area. India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture, is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India'}\n"

First, we\\nintroduce a reinforcement learning paradigm for on-policy data-driven LQR, where exploration and exploitation\\nare simultaneously performed while guaranteeing robust stability of the whole closed-loop system encompassing\\nthe plant and the control/learning dynamics. Then, we propose Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning\\n(MR-ARL), a control architecture integrating tools from reinforcement learning and model reference adaptive\\ncontrol. The approach stands on a variable reference model containing the currently identified value function.\\nThen, an adaptive stabilizer is used to ensure convergence of the applied policy to the optimal one, convergence of\\nthe plant to the optimal reference model, and overall robust closed-loop stability. The proposed framework provides\\ntheoretical robustness certificates against real-world perturbations such as measurement noise, plant nonlinearities,\\nor slowly varying parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is validated via realistic numerical\\nsimulations.\\nIndex Terms\\nData-driven control, linear quadratic regulator, model reference adaptive control, optimal control, reinforcement\\nlearning.\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nR\\nEINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL) is a machine learning field that emerged to perform optimiza-\\ntion and decision-making by interacting with an environment without or with limited knowledge of\\nits mathematical model [2], [3]. Over the past years, this field has been successfully applied to multiple\\ndomains, including computer games, biology, and economics and finance. RL has garnered the attention\\nof the control engineering community, where it has been used to address optimal control in uncertain\\nor model-free scenarios. Learning from system data aligns RL with principles found in adaptive control\\nliterature [4], which seeks to design dynamic controllers for regulation and tracking in the presence of\\nmodel uncertainties. This work systematically investigates the connection between the fields of optimal\\nand adaptive control, paving the way for a new RL paradigm that provides formal certificates of robust\\nclosed-loop learning and control, thereby leading to effective performance in real-world applications.\\nIn particular, we focus on solving the infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem by\\ndeveloping an on-policy data-driven algorithm where data collection and optimization are done simul-\\ntaneously by applying the learned policy to the actual system. The requirements of our framework are\\nschematically presented below in Table I and later formalized in Section II. A key distinctive feature\\nof our proposed framework is the requirement of robust asymptotic stability for the whole closed-loop\\nsystem including both the learning and control dynamics. This requirement, as elucidated in the subsequent\\nsections, encapsulates the notion that the proven learning features in nominal cases must persist in perturbed\\nscenarios, encompassing disturbances, measurement noise, slowly varying parameters, and sample-and-\\nhold implementations. With a priori guarantees of effective closed-loop controller implementation, our\\nframework is particularly tailored for safety-critical applications, such as collaborative robotics and aircraft\\ncontrol. Motivated by the above discussion, we provide an overview of the literature pertaining to data-\\ndriven LQR, distinguishing between both so-called off-policy and on-policy approaches. Then, we recall\\nmodel reference adaptive control, one of the main inspirations of the approach of this article.\\nM. Borghesi, A. Bosso, and G. Notarstefano are with the Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, Alma Mater\\nStudiorum - Universit`a di Bologna, 40136 Bologna, Italy. The corresponding author is M. Borghesi (e-mail: m.borghesi@unibo.it).\\nA preliminary version of this work is given in [1].\\narXiv:2402.14483v1  [eess.SY]  22 Feb 2024\\n2\\nTABLE I Robustly stable on-policy data-driven LQR\\nPlant:\\n˙x = Ax + Bu,\\n(1)\\nwith state x ∈ Rn, input u ∈ Rm, and matrices A and B.\\nInfinite-horizon LQR: find an optimal control policy π⋆ : Rn → Rm such that u(t) = π⋆(x(t))\\nminimizes, for all initial conditions x0 ∈ Rn, the following cost functional along the solutions of the\\nplant:\\nJ(x0, u(·)):=\\nZ ∞\\n0\\nx(τ)⊤Qx(τ) + u(τ)⊤Ru(τ)dτ,\\n(2)\\nwith tuning matrices Q = Q⊤ ≥ 0, R = R⊤ > 0.\\nProblem: with A and B partially or totally unknown, find a controller of the form\\n˙z = φ(x, z, d)\\nlearning dynamics\\nu = π(x, z, d)\\napplied control policy\\n(3)\\nwith z ∈ Z ⊂ Rℓ and d ∈ Rq a dither signal, such that the following properties are achieved.\\n1) Exploration: d probes the uncertainties of A and B.\\n2) Exploitation: map x 7→ π(x, z, 0) converges to the optimal policy x 7→ π⋆(x).\\n3) Robust stability: learning is enforced through robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system.\\nOff-Policy Data-Driven LQR: Off-policy approaches involve finding the optimal policy without applying\\nit at the same time to the actual system. In this context, we find iterative methods, often inspired by the\\nKleinman algorithm, involving either parameter identification or direct estimate of the policy [5]–[11].\\nTypically, in these methods, the stabilization of the controlled system during the evolution of the learning\\nalgorithm is circumvented by assuming an initial stabilizing policy. However, as discussed in [12], there\\nare situations where this assumption may be unrealistic due to plant uncertainties. The algorithm [13]\\ndoes not need this assumption. Finally, other relevant paradigms for off-policy approaches involve batch\\nidentification of the policy from data [14]–[19] and system-level synthesis [20]. All these approaches\\ndiffer from our setup, since the exploration and exploitation phases are not performed simultaneously.\\nOn-Policy Data-Driven LQR: As compared to off-policy approaches, the on-policy paradigm adds the\\nsignificant challenge of ensuring stability of the interconnection between the plant and the control/learning\\nalgorithm. Early attempts to address this setup are [21]–[27], where the stabilizing feedback gain is updated\\nat discrete iterations. However, the stability of the whole closed-loop system is not analyzed and an initial\\nstabilizing policy is required, similar to off-policy approaches. A data-driven approach to compute the\\ninitial gain is presented in [28]. To the best of our knowledge, [29] is the only work in the literature\\nthat provides stability guarantees without a stabilizing initialization, although the focus is on the learning\\ndynamics and not the overall closed-loop system.\\nModel Reference Adaptive Control: We finally review the literature dealing with model reference\\nadaptive control (MRAC). The principle of this technique is to match the unknown system dynamics\\nto a reference model with desired properties [30]–[32]. To ensure design feasibility, this stabilization\\ntechnique requires the plant to satisfy constraints named matching conditions. A recent work combining\\nMRAC and RL is [33], where RL techniques are used to find the optimal controller for a reference model\\nbased on nominal plant parameters. Then, MRAC is applied to assign the reference model to the real\\nsystem. However, convergence to the desired policy is not proved and can only be ensured to a policy\\nthat is optimal for the reference model and not the true system.\\nArticle Contribution: The goal of this article is to lay the foundations for a new paradigm of on-policy\\ndata-driven LQR according to the problem setting described in Table I. The main paper contribution is\\ntwofold: (i) introducing a novel formulation of the on-policy data-driven LQR problem where centrality\\nis given to the stability of the whole closed-loop learning and control system; (ii) providing a combined\\n3\\nadaptive control and reinforcement learning design paradigm to address this framework.\\nConcerning our first contribution, we formulate the on-policy data-driven LQR problem in terms of\\nconvergence of the controller, the plant, and an exosystem (modeling the dither signal) to an asymptotically\\nstable set. The fundamental property defining this set is that the learned policy is optimal. Additionally,\\nthe set becomes smaller as the dither amplitude is reduced. Thanks to this formulation, we ensure that\\nasymptotic stability in the nominal scenario is preserved, practically and semiglobally, also for a broad\\nclass of perturbations, see [34, Ch. 7]. With the generality of the proposed framework, we aim to provide\\na solid foundation for future work in the field.\\nThe second and main contribution of this work consists in introducing an on-policy learning and\\ncontrol law, termed Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (MR-ARL), integrating concepts\\nfrom system identification, adaptive control, and reinforcement learning paradigms. The architecture is\\nstructured as a modular actor-critic system with a time-varying reference model bridging the two modules.\\nThe actor, inspired to a MRAC architecture, guides the plant to a desired behavior set by the reference\\nmodel, even in the presence of parametric uncertainties. The reference model is updated online by the\\ncritic, which leverages system identification techniques to estimate the dynamics. To impose the desired\\nlearning properties, the reference model is driven by a dither signal for which we require suitable richness\\nproperties. By relying on analysis tools related to adaptive control, differential inclusions, and singular\\nperturbations, we prove formally that our architecture achieves the following properties for the whole\\nclosed-loop system: (i) convergence of the policy to the optimal one; (ii) asymptotic estimation of the true\\nsystem parameters; (iii) uniform asymptotic stability of an attractor (tunable with the dither amplitude); (iv)\\nrobustness in the sense of semiglobal practical asymptotic stability with respect to unmodeled nonlinearities\\nand disturbances. To the best of authors’ knowledge, in the context of on-policy data-driven LQR, this\\nalgorithm is the first one possessing all these properties. Also, no assumptions are needed about the initial\\npolicy. Further, persistency of excitation, needed to ensure convergence, is not assumed a priori, but rather\\nguaranteed by design by resorting to concepts from nonlinear adaptive systems [35]. Finally, given the\\ninherent robustness of the proposed design framework, we ensure that the algorithm is effective in the\\npresence of slowly varying parameters. To validate this property, our numerical simulations cover both\\nthe constant parameters case and the one with drifts.\\nIn Section II, we provide preliminary concepts of LQR and introduce the on-policy data-driven paradigm\\nthat formalizes Table I. Then, Section III presents MR-ARL and its derivation, while Section IV provides\\nits stability properties. The technical results for the stability analysis are given in Section V, while all\\nrelated proofs are left in the Appendix. Finally, Section VI provides in-depth numerical results.\\nNotation: The set of real numbers is denoted by R, while R≥0 := [0, +∞).

PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM SETUP\\nFollowing the discussion in the introduction, we now provide a rigorous formulation of the on-policy\\ndata-driven linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem addressed in the paper.\\nA. Linear Quadratic Regulation\\nWe start by introducing the basic concepts of LQR for system (1) and the cost functional (2). The infinite-\\nhorizon LQR problem involves finding a control policy π⋆ : Rn → Rm such that applying u(t) = π⋆(x(t))\\n4\\nfor all t ∈ R≥0 solves, for all initial conditions x0 ∈ Rn, the following optimal control problem:\\nmin\\nu(·) J(x0, u(·)) :=\\nZ ∞\\n0\\nx(τ)⊤Qx(τ) + u(τ)⊤Ru(τ)dτ\\nsubject to:\\n˙x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),\\n∀t ∈ R≥0,\\nx(0) = x0.\\n(4)\\nUnder the assumption that pair (A, B) be stabilizable and (√Q, A) be detectable, the LQR problem (4)\\nis solved by the linear policy:\\nπ⋆(x) := K⋆x,\\nK⋆ := −R−1B⊤P ⋆,\\n(5)\\nwhere P ⋆ ∈ Sn\\n0 is the unique solution of the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE):\\nA⊤P ⋆ + P ⋆A − P ⋆BR−1B⊤P ⋆ + Q = 0.\\n(6)\\nAdditionally, P ⋆ ∈ Sn\\n+ if pair (√Q, A) is observable. We also recall that P ⋆ specifies the value function,\\nwhich is defined, for a given initial condition x, as the minimum of J(x, u(·)):\\nV ⋆(x) := min\\nu(·) J(x, u(·)) := x⊤P ⋆x.\\n(7)\\nConsider the differential Riccati equation (DRE) with flow set constrained to symmetric positive semidef-\\ninite matrices:\\n˙P = A⊤P + PA − PBR−1B⊤P + Q,\\nP ∈ Sn\\n0 .\\n(8)\\nThen, if (A, B) is stabilizable and (√Q, A) is detectable, the equilibrium point P ⋆ is uniformly globally\\nasymptotically stable (UGAS) for the constrained differential equation (8) [36, Thm. 15]. Furthermore, if\\n(A, B) is controllable and (√Q, A) is observable, P ⋆ is uniformly locally exponentially stable (ULES)\\n[37, Thm. 4]. Formal results describing the stability properties of DRE (8) are provided in [36], [37].\\nB. Robustly Stable On-Policy Data-Driven LQR\\nSolving the LQR problem (4) involves computing the solution P ⋆ of ARE (5), which depends on the\\nmatrices A and B of plant (1). Therefore, if A and B are unknown or only partially known, it is necessary\\nto resort to data-driven approaches based on acquiring the data of the state-input sequences (x(t), u(t))\\n(continuously or via batches).\\nIn this work, we are interested in finding an on-policy data-driven algorithm, where data collection and\\nlearning are performed simultaneously by applying the learned policy. We now provide a novel rigorous\\nframework to formalize this problem so that its solution guarantees, by design, desirable learning and\\nrobust stability properties.\\nAs anticipated in the introduction, the class of controllers that we seek are described by continuous-time\\ndynamical systems of the form\\n˙z = φ(x, z, d)\\nu = π(x, z, d)\\nz ∈ Z,\\n(9)\\nwhere z is the controller state, Z ⊂ Rℓ is a closed set, d ∈ Rq is a uniformly bounded signal, named\\nhereafter dither, while φ and π are maps that are locally Lipschitz in their arguments. To the algorithm\\n(9), we associate the learning set L, defined as:\\nL := {z ∈ Z : π(x, z, 0) = K⋆x, ∀x ∈ Rn},\\n(10)\\nwhich denotes the set of all controller states such that the control policy π coincides with the optimal\\npolicy π⋆ in (5) whenever the dither d is turned off.\\n5\\nIn (9), d is an exogenous signal that may include references for tracking, probing signals, or disturbances.\\nTo ensure well-posedness of the problem formulation, from now on we consider a general class of signals\\nd that can be generated by an autonomous dynamical system (exosystem) of the form\\n˙w = s(w)\\nd = h(w)\\nw ∈ W,\\n(11)\\nwhere w is the exosystem state, W ⊂ Rp is the set of admissible initial conditions w(0), while s and h\\nare locally Lipschitz maps. Since d is a bounded signal defined for all t ∈ R≥0, we suppose that the set\\nW be compact and strongly forward invariant under the flow of (11).\\nRemark 1. Exosystem (11) is not implemented in the control solution but is used to represent the class\\nof admissible signals d. Moreover, the results of the paper hold if (11) is replaced by a well-posed hybrid\\ndynamical system [34] to include discontinuous dither signals. Here, we use a continuous-time exosystem\\nto avoid an additional notational burden.\\nThe closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of exosystem (11), plant (1), and controller\\n(9) is given by\\n˙w = s(w)\\n˙x = Ax + Bπ(x, z, h(w))\\n˙z = φ(x, z, h(w))\\n(w, x, z) ∈ W × Rn × Z.\\n(12)\\nWe are ready to precisely state the requirements for controller (9), which include a precise stability\\ncharacterization for the closed-loop system (12).\\nDefinition 1. We say that controller (9) solves the robustly stable on-policy data-driven LQR problem if\\nthe learning set L in (10) is non-empty and, for a chosen class of dither signals d generated by exosystem\\n(11), there exists a compact attractor A, satisfying\\nA ⊂ W × Rn × L,\\n(13)\\nthat is asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system (12).\\nWe show that any algorithm satisfying Definition 1 covers all of the design requirements stated in the\\nintroduction.\\n• Exploration: choosing the dither d determines the shape and the attractivity properties of A, thus it\\nensures the necessary probing to estimate the optimal policy.\\n• Exploitation: since the projection of A in the z direction is a subset of the learning set L, uniform\\nattractivity of A (encoded in asymptotic stability) ensures z → L and, thus, correct estimation of the\\noptimal policy.\\n• Robust stability: under the regularity properties required for the controller and assumed for the\\nexosystem, asymptotic stability of the attractor A is preserved (practically and semiglobally) under\\na broad range of non-vanishing perturbations arising in real-world scenarios, such as disturbances,\\nmeasurement noise, unmodeled dynamics, sample-and-hold implementations of the controller, and\\nactuator dynamics.\\nRemark 2. In Definition 1, we do not specify the restrictions on the knowledge of A and B to cover a\\nbroad range of applications and solutions. However, the prior knowledge on the parametric uncertainties\\ndetermines the design of φ, π, and Z. Note that, if controller (9) is not appropriately chosen, the learning\\nset may be empty.\\nRemark 3. The convergence of z to the learning set L in Definition 1 implies that the controlled plant\\nbecomes asymptotically:\\n˙x = (A + BK⋆)x + ∆(x, z, d),\\n(14)\\n6\\nModel Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning\\nACTOR\\nCRITIC\\nPlant\\nx\\nReference model\\nxm\\nAdaptive stabilizer\\nˆKa\\nValue function identifier\\nξ, ζ, ˆA, ˆP\\nx\\nxm, d\\nˆA, ˆP\\nu\\nExosystem\\nw\\nd\\nFig. 1. Block scheme of the Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning.\\nwhere ∆(x, z, d) := B(π(x, z, d)−K⋆x) vanishes in d = 0. Moreover, since ∆(x, z, d) is locally Lipschitz,\\nit is uniformly bounded for all (x, z, w) in the compact attractor A. As a consequence, the input-to-state\\nstability of (14) implies that\\nlim sup\\nt→∞\\n|x(t)| ≤ α(lim sup\\nt→∞\\n|d(t)|),\\n(15)\\nwhere α is a class K function. In other words, the ultimate bound of x directly depends on the amplitude\\nof the injected dither d.\\nIII. MODEL REFERENCE ADAPTIVE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\\nWe now present a new control and learning approach, named Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement\\nLearning (MR-ARL), which satisfies Definition 1 in a scenario of structured uncertainties characterized\\nby the following assumptions.\\nAssumption 1. There exists a known closed convex set C ⊂ Rn×n such that:\\n1) C has a non-empty interior and A ∈ Int(C);\\n2) ( ˆA, B) is controllable and (√Q, ˆA) is observable for all ˆA ∈ C.\\nRemark 4. From [29], [38], it is known that if there exists A0 such that (A0, B) is controllable and\\n(√Q, A0) is observable, then there exists a scalar ρ > 0 such that (A, B) is controllable and (√Q, A) is\\nobservable for all A such that |A − A0| ≤ ρ. Therefore, during implementation, the set C can be chosen\\nas a ball centered in a nominal value A0 of A with radius ρ chosen to include all possible uncertainties.\\nAssumption 2. Consider the linear map B : K ∈ Rm×n 7−→ BK ∈ Rn×n, where B is the input matrix\\nin (1). For some known A0 ∈ C, it holds that\\nA0 − A ∈ Im(B).\\n(16)\\nRemark 5. Assumption 2 is an alternative formulation of the matching conditions used in the MRAC\\nliterature [30]. Notice that for any ˆA such that ˆA−A0 ∈ Im(B), by ˆA−A0+(A0−A) = ˆA−A ∈ Im(B),\\nthere exists Ka ∈ Rm×n such that\\nˆA − A = BKa.\\n(17)\\n7\\nAlgorithm 1 MR-ARL\\nInitialization:\\nˆP(0) ∈ Sn\\n0 , ˆA(0) ∈ Θ, with Θ from Remark 5\\nλ, γ, ν, g, µ > 0 design gains\\nd(t): bounded and stationary signal with each entry sufficiently rich of order n + 1 and uncorrelated\\nRepeat:\\nSwapping filters:\\n˙ξ = −λξ + x,\\n˙ζ = −λ(x + ζ) − Bu\\n(19)\\nIdentifier dynamics:\\n˙ˆA = Proj\\nˆ\\nA∈C\\n\\x1a\\n−γBB†\\nϵξ⊤\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n\\x1b\\n,\\nϵ := ˆAξ−(x + ζ)\\n(20)\\nValue iteration:\\n˙ˆP = g\\n\\x10\\nˆA⊤ˆP + ˆP ˆA − ˆPBR−1B⊤ˆP + Q\\n\\x11\\n(21)\\nReference model:\\n˙xm = ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)xm + Bd\\n(22)\\nAdaptive gain dynamics:\\n˙ˆKa = −µB⊤ ˆP(x − xm)x⊤ + B† ˙ˆA\\n(23)\\nSystem input:\\nu = −R−1B⊤ ˆPx + ˆKax + d\\n(24)\\nGiven the two sets C and A0 + Im(B), we are interested in all matrices ˆA ∈ Θ, where\\nΘ := C ∩ (A0 + Im(B))\\n(18)\\nsince they can be used to build reference models.\\nOur controller is conceived as an actor-critic modular architecture where a reference model bridges the\\ntwo parts of the design. The resulting structure is a MRAC where the reference model is continuously\\nupdated with value iteration, thus we aptly name it Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning.\\nWe introduce the building blocks of the design.\\n• Critic: this block performs data-driven value function identification to build an optimal and asymp-\\ntotically stable reference model. In particular, a gradient identifier computes an estimate ˆA ∈ Θ of\\nA that is used to obtain an estimate ˆP of the solution P ⋆ of ARE (6). In this respect, Assumption\\n1 guarantees that for any estimate ˆA the computation of ˆP is feasible. Then, ˆA and the optimal\\ngain estimate −R−1B⊤ ˆP are used to build a reference model having state matrix ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP.\\nAs input to the reference model, we consider a dither d with sufficient richness properties to ensure\\nconvergence to the true system parameters and to the optimal policy.\\n• Actor: this block assigns the input to the plant to adaptively track the reference model. During\\nthe transient, the feedback gain −R−1B⊤ ˆP may be not stabilizing for the real system. For this\\nreason, the actor introduces in the control law an additional adaptive feedback gain ˆKa to cancel the\\nmismatch between the estimated matrix ˆA and the real A. Canceling such a mismatch is possible\\ndue to Assumption 2.\\nSee Fig. 1 for a block scheme of Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning. The full descrip-\\ntion of the design is presented in Algorithm 1 and discussed in detail in the next subsections.\\n8\\nA. Critic: Value Function Identifier\\nIn this subsection, we build a continuous-time identifier of P ⋆ based on the estimation of matrix A.\\nGiven the structure of system (1), we compute an estimate ˆA ∈ Θ of A by designing a swapping filter of\\nthe form (19), with λ > 0 a scalar gain for tuning the filter time constant. Using the filter states, define\\nthe prediction error\\nϵ := ˆAξ − (x + ζ),\\n(25)\\nwhich we can rewrite as ϵ = ( ˆA − A)ξ + ˜ϵ, where\\n˜ϵ := Aξ − (x + ζ),\\n(26)\\nis an error signal that is shown in Section V to converge exponentially to zero. Since the available signal ϵ\\nconverges exponentially to ( ˆA−A)ξ, which contains the parameter estimation error ˆA−A, we can use the\\nnormalized projected gradient descent algorithm (20) to update the estimate ˆA. In (20), parameters γ > 0\\nand ν > 0 are scalar gains, while the multiplicative term BB† is a projection onto Im(B) [39, Sec. 5.5.4].\\nThis projection is needed to ensure, given any initialization ˆA(0) ∈ A0 + Im(B), that the estimate ˆA(t)\\nnever leaves this subspace. Finally, Proj ˆ\\nA∈C{·} is a Lipschitz continuous parameter projection operator,\\nwhose expression is provided, e.g., in [40, Appendix E] and depends on the shape of the set C.\\nGiven the estimate ˆA, we are interested in computing the matrix ˆP ∈ Sn\\n+ that solves the ARE\\nR(P, ˆA) := ˆA⊤P + P ˆA − PBR−1B⊤P + Q = 0.\\n(27)\\nFrom [1], such a matrix could be obtained by computing the map P( ˆA) that solves (27) for each ˆA, i.e.,\\nsuch that:\\nR(P( ˆA), ˆA) = 0,\\nfor all ˆA ∈ Θ.\\n(28)\\nFor simplicity in the implementation and inspired by [29], in Algorithm 1, we compute ˆP via the dynamical\\nsystem (21), which is a DRE rescaled by the tuning gain g > 0. Notice that, if ˆA is constant, then the\\nsolution ˆP of (21) converges to P( ˆA).\\nRemark 6. Assumption 1 guarantees that, for each ˆA ∈ Θ, P( ˆA) exists, is unique, and positive definite\\nfor any ˆA ∈ Θ. Although stabilizability of ( ˆA, B) would be sufficient in Assumption 1 for the solvability\\nof R(P, ˆA) = 0, controllability is essential to guarantee convergence of the identifier under sufficient\\nrichness of the dither d. Moreover, we need observability instead of simple detectability to ensure that\\nP( ˆA) is positive definite.\\nRemark 7. From Assumption 1 and the parameter projection in (20), matrix ˆA−BR−1B⊤P( ˆA) is Hurwitz\\nby design. Therefore, if ˆA converges to a constant matrix, (21) ensures that ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP converges to\\na Hurwitz matrix.\\nB. Reference Model\\nGiven the estimate ˆP of P ⋆, we design a reference model for system (1). The reference model has to\\nembed all the properties required for the plant, i.e., robust stability, optimality and persistency of excitation.\\nTo these aims, consider system (22), where xm ∈ Rn is the reference model state. We embed the stability\\nand optimality properties through ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP, which is designed to converge to a Hurwitz matrix.\\nRemark 8. Different from classic MRAC, the state matrix ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP of the reference model (22) is\\nnot constant but time-varying as it depends on the estimates ˆA and ˆP. This property leads to an adaptive\\ndesign where the known-plant stabilizing gains are time-varying.\\nFinally, we embed the persistency of excitation properties through dither d ∈ Rm, which is chosen such\\nthat it is a bounded stationary signal, whose entries are sufficiently rich of order n + 1 and uncorrelated.\\nRemark 9. We model d(t) as the output of an exosystem of the form (11). It is not necessary to actually\\nimplement the exosystem as part of the algorithm, as we show in the numerical example.\\n9\\nC. Actor: Model Reference Adaptive Controller\\nGiven the reference model (22), we design an adaptive controller for system (1). Define the tracking\\nerror e := x − xm and compute its time derivative from (1), (22) as\\n˙e = Ax + Bu − ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)(x − e) − Bd\\n= ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)e + (A − ˆA)x + B(u + R−1B⊤ ˆPx − d).\\n(29)\\nTo ensure that the plant (1) asymptotically copies the behavior of the reference model (22), i.e., e(t) → 0,\\nwe exploit the fact that ˆA ∈ Θ. In particular, from (17), for each ˆA there exists Ka( ˆA) ∈ Rm×n such that\\nˆA − A = BKa( ˆA).\\n(30)\\nMore specifically, we can ensure that map Ka( ˆA) is smooth in ˆA by choosing:\\nKa( ˆA) := B†( ˆA − A),\\n(31)\\nwhere B† denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of B. This way, (29) becomes\\n˙e = ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)e + B(u + R−1B⊤ ˆPx − Ka( ˆA)x − d),\\n(32)\\nsuggesting a control law of the form\\nu := −R−1B⊤ ˆPx + Ka( ˆA)x + d\\n(33)\\nif the plant dynamics were known. However, Ka( ˆA) is unavailable for design as it depends also on A,\\nas highlighted in (30), thus we consider the certainty-equivalence-based adaptive controller given in (24),\\nwhere Ka( ˆA) is replaced by the adaptive gain ˆKa, driven by the adaptive law (23) where µ > 0 is a scalar\\ngain. The first term in the adaptive law (23) is a standard update to ensure the error e goes asymptotically\\nto zero in a framework where the model mismatch is constant. However, since ˆA is continuously updated\\nby identifier (20), the second term in the update law takes into account the time-varying mismatch.\\nIV. MAIN RESULT\\nWe now provide the main results of this work, where we show that Model Reference Adaptive\\nReinforcement Learning solves the robustly stable on-policy data-driven LQR problem as per Definition\\n1. The first result is given supposing to have a DRE dynamics in (21) infinitely faster than the rest of the\\nsystem (reduced-order system), i.e., supposing ˆP(t) = P(A(t)) as in (28) at each t. For this reason, we\\nmark the results for the reduced-order system with a subscript s to highlight its slow dynamics. We then\\nfollow a singular perturbation approach to prove also Algorithm 1 solves the robustly stable on-policy\\ndata-driven LQR problem.\\nA. Stability Result for the Reduced-Order System\\nConsider the Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning with ARE implementation of ˆP as\\nin (28). Following the notation of Section II, the controller obtained by combining the value function\\nidentifier (19), (20), (28), reference model (22), and the adaptive stabilizer (23), (24) is in the form (9),\\nwith state\\nzs := (ξ, ζ, ˆA, xm, ˆKa) ∈ Zs := R2n × Θ × Rn × Rm×n,\\n(34)\\nand output policy\\nπ(x, zs, d) := ( ˆKa − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA))x + d,\\n(35)\\nfrom which it follows that the learning set L in (10) is non-empty and given by\\nLs := {zs ∈ Zs : ˆKa − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA) = −BR−1B⊤P ⋆}.\\n(36)\\n10\\nIn particular, we recall that our algorithm aims at reaching the learning set by ensuring ˆA → A (hence\\nˆP ≡ P( ˆA) → P ⋆ by continuity of the map P( ˆA)) and ˆKa → 0. The following result shows that, with\\nγ > 0 sufficiently small, the Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning with ARE implementation\\nof ˆP solves the robustly stable on-policy data-driven LQR problem.\\nTheorem 1. Consider the closed-loop system given by the interconnection of plant (1) and the controller\\nof Algorithm 1, with ˆP(t) = P( ˆA(t)) for all t and P( ˆA) satisfying (28). Let the stationary dither d be\\ngenerated by an exosystem of the form (11) and let its entries be sufficiently rich of order n + 1 and\\nuncorrelated. Then, there exists γ⋆ > 0 such that, for all γ ∈ (0, γ⋆], there exists a compact set As\\nsatisfying\\nAs ⊂ {(w, x, zs) ∈ W × Rn × Ls : ˆA = A, ˆKa = 0, x = xm, ϵ = 0}\\n(37)\\nthat is uniformly globally asymptotically stable.\\nB. Stability Result for MR-ARL\\nConsider the Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (MR-ARL) algorithm with DRE\\nimplementation of ˆP as in (21) (Algorithm 1). Following the notation of Section II, the controller obtained\\nby combining the value function identifier (19), (20), (21), reference model (22), and the adaptive stabilizer\\n(23), (24) is in the form (9), with state\\nz := (zs, ˆP) ∈ Z := Zs × Sn\\n0 ,\\n(38)\\nwhere zs and Zs are given in (34). The output policy then becomes\\nπ(x, z, d) := ( ˆKa − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)x + d,\\n(39)\\nand the learning set L is given by\\nL := {z ∈ Z : ˆKa − BR−1B⊤ ˆP = −BR−1B⊤P ⋆}.\\n(40)\\nIn this case, the learning set is reached via ˆA → A (hence ˆP → P ⋆ by asymptotic stability of the DRE\\n(8)) and ˆKa → 0. The next result, which is the main result of this work, shows that with γ > 0 sufficiently\\nsmall and g > 0 sufficiently large, the Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning in Algorithm\\n1 solves the robustly stable on-policy data-driven LQR problem.\\nTheorem 2. Consider the closed-loop system given by the interconnection of plant (1) and the controller\\nof Algorithm 1. Pick d and γ as in Theorem 1. Then, the compact set\\nA:=As × P ⋆ ⊂ {(w, x, z) ∈ W × Rn × L : ˆA = A, ˆKa = 0, x = xm, ϵ = 0, P = P ⋆}\\n(41)\\nis semiglobally uniformly asymptotically stable in the tuning parameter g > 0, where As is given in (37)\\nand g is the one in (21). Namely, for any compact set K ⊂ W × Rn × Z of initial conditions for the\\nclosed-loop system, there exists g > 0 such that A is uniformly asymptotically stable with domain of\\nattraction containing K.\\nV. ALGORITHM ANALYSIS\\nIn the following, we will only study the properties of the reduced-order version of the algorithm, i.e.,\\nwith ˆP(t) = P(A(t)) for all t and P( ˆA) satisfying (28). The second result, i.e., the stability of Algorithm 1\\n(implementing the DRE), is obtained by invoking singular perturbations techniques.\\nA. Error Dynamics\\nWe begin the analysis by presenting the closed-loop dynamics in error coordinates, which is used to\\nprovide the technical results of the following subsections.\\n11\\n1) Identifier Dynamics: Consider the error coordinate ˜ϵ in (26), which can be written as\\n˜ϵ := Aξ − (x + ζ).\\n(42)\\nThen, from (1), (19), it holds that\\n˙˜ϵ = A(−λξ + x) − (Ax + Bu − λ(x + ζ) − Bu)\\n= −λ(Aξ − (x + ζ)) = −λ˜ϵ,\\n(43)\\nwhich ensures that the prediction error ϵ := ˆAξ − (x + ζ) = ( ˆA − A)ξ + ˜ϵ converges to ( ˆA − A)ξ\\nexponentially.\\nDefine ˜A := ˆA − A. Then, from (26), (43), we can rewrite the identifier dynamics (19), (20), (25) in\\nerror coordinates as the following cascaded system\\n˙˜ϵ = −λ˜ϵ\\n˙˜A =Proj\\nˆ\\nA∈C\\n(\\n−γBB† ˜Aξξ⊤ + ˜ϵξ⊤\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n)\\n,\\n(44)\\ndriven by ξ(t), solution of the filter\\n˙ξ = −λξ + x.\\n(45)\\nRemark 10. To ensure ˆA(t) → A, it is known from the adaptive control literature that vector ξ(t) must\\nbe a persistently exciting (PE) signal [31]. However, notice that ξ(t) is a filtered version of x(t), which\\nis generated in closed-loop by interconnecting the plant and the controller. For this reason, special care\\nwill be dedicated to its analysis.\\n2) Reference Model Dynamics: From (28), when ˆP = P( ˆA), system (22) can be written highlighting\\nthe dependence on the estimate ˆA of the identifier:\\n˙xm = ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA))xm + Bd,\\n(46)\\nwhere from (20), (28), the pointwise-in-time value of P( ˆA) is provided implicitly as the solution of a\\nparameter-varying ARE. By [41, Thm. 4.1], P( ˆA) is an analytic function of ˆA, being all matrices of ARE\\nR(P, ˆA) = 0 in (27) analytic functions of ˆA ∈ Θ. From this fact, matrix ˆA − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA) is Hurwitz\\nand an analytic function of ˆA.\\n3) Adaptive Tracking Dynamics: We conclude this overview by studying the interconnection of the error\\ndynamics (32) and the adaptive controller (23), (24). We define ˜Ka := ˆKa − Ka( ˆA). By choosing (24) as\\ninput for (29), we obtain:\\n˙e = ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA))e + B( ˆKax − K( ˆA)x)\\n(47)\\nBy choosing expression (31) for Ka( ˆA), we can explicitly calculate the variation in time of Ka( ˆA) due\\nto the movement of ˆA. This is out of the standard framework of model reference adaptive control, and\\nthus particular attention is required. We can calculate the time derivative of Ka( ˆA) by deriving (31):\\n˙Ka = B† ˙ˆA.\\n(48)\\nSince both B and ˙ˆA are known, we can use their knowledge to implement adaptive law (23), which takes\\ninto account this drift. Given equations (23) and (48), the induced dynamics for ˜Ka is:\\n˙˜Ka = ˙ˆKa − ˙Ka\\n= −µB⊤P( ˆA)(x − xm)x⊤ + B† ˙ˆA − B† ˙ˆA\\n= −µB⊤P( ˆA)ex⊤.\\n(49)\\n12\\nB. Global Boundedness of Solutions\\nWe now show boundedness and forward completeness of the solutions of the closed-loop system\\nobtained from the interconnection of the identifier dynamics (44), (45), the reference model (46), and\\nthe adaptive error system (47), (49). The overall analysis entails proving uniform bounds on the solutions\\nof the main involved subsystems, then combining the results using arguments similar to [40, Thm. 6.3]\\n(see the proof of Proposition 1). To increase readability, we leave the proofs of the technical lemmas in\\nthe Appendix.\\nWe begin by showing uniform boundedness of ˆA and ˙ˆA.\\nLemma 1. Let the maximal interval of solutions of (44), (45), (46), (47), (49) be [0, tf). Then, it holds\\nthat\\nI ) ˜ϵ(·), ˜A(·) are uniformly bounded in the interval [0, tf)\\nII ) ˆA(t) ∈ Θ for all t ∈ [0, tf)\\nFurthermore, if tf = ∞, the origin (˜ϵ, ˜A) = 0 of system (44), driven by input ξ(t), is uniformly globally\\nstable (UGS).\\nLemma 2. Let the maximal interval of solutions of (44), (45), (46), (47), (49) be [0, tf). Then, it holds\\nthat\\n| ˙ˆA(t)| ≤ γ,\\n∀t ∈ [0, tf).\\n(50)\\nRemark 11. The above results hold even if the input ξ(t) of the identifier escapes to infinity as t → tf.\\nAlthough the overall boundedness analysis entails also the study of ξ(t), system (45) ISS with respect\\nto input x(t), thus its behavior will be analyzed directly in Proposition 1.\\nThen, we show that the reference model (46) is bounded as long as | ˙ˆA(t)| is sufficiently small.\\nLemma 3. Let the maximal interval of solutions of (44), (45), (46), (47), (49) be [0, tf). There exists\\nγ⋆\\nb > 0 such that, if | ˙ˆA(t)| ≤ γ⋆\\nb for all t ∈ [0, tf), then xm(·) is uniformly bounded over the interval\\n[0, tf). Furthermore, if tf = ∞, then the reference model (46) with input d(t) is input-to-state stable.\\nNext, we provide a statement for system (47), (49).\\nLemma 4. Let the maximal interval of solutions of (44), (45), (46), (47), (49) be [0, tf). Pick γ⋆\\nb > 0\\nfrom Lemma 3 and let | ˙ˆA(t)| ≤ γ⋆\\nb for all t ∈ [0, tf). Then, signals e(·), ˜Ka(·) are uniformly bounded in\\nthe interval [0, tf). Furthermore, if tf = ∞, the origin (e, ˜Ka) = 0 of system (47), (49), with input ˆA(t),\\nis UGS.\\nFinally, we combine the previous results to obtain that solutions are globally bounded and forward\\ncomplete.\\nProposition 1. Consider the closed-loop system obtained from the interconnection of the identifier dy-\\nnamics (44), (45), the reference model (46), and the adaptive error system (47), (49). Pick γ⋆\\nb from Lemma\\n2. If γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nb], then the closed-loop solutions are bounded and forward complete.\\nProof. Suppose that the maximal interval of existence of the solution of (44), (45), (46), (47), and (49) is\\n[0, tf). Then, from Lemma 1, ˜A(·) and ˜ϵ(·) are uniformly bounded. From Lemma 2, | ˙ˆA(·)| is uniformly\\nbounded by γ. Consider any γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nb], then Lemmas 3 and 4 ensure that xm(·), e(·), and ˜Ka(·) are\\nuniformly bounded, thus also ξ(·) is uniformly bounded from (45) and standard ISS results.\\nWe have thus shown that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded, with bounds that do not\\ndepend on tf. By contradiction, we conclude that tf = ∞, thus the solutions are forward complete. Namely,\\nif tf were finite, the solutions would leave any compact set as t → tf, contradicting the independence of\\nthe bounds on tf [40, Thm. 6.3].\\n13\\nC. Exponential Convergence to the Optimal Policy\\nWe now focus on the uniform asymptotic stability properties of the closed-loop system (44), (45), (46),\\n(47), (49). First, we show that xm(t) is persistently exciting as long as | ˙ˆA| is sufficiently small.\\nLemma 5. Let the entries of stationary input d be sufficiently rich of order n+1 and uncorrelated. There\\nexists γ⋆\\nPE ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nb], with γ⋆\\nb from Proposition 1, such that, for all γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nPE], the solutions xm(t) of\\nthe reference model (46) are persistently exciting (PE).\\nNext, we provide a direct consequence of Lemma 5 for the adaptive error dynamics (47), (49).\\nLemma 6. Let the hypotheses of Lemma 5 hold and let γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nPE], where γ⋆\\nPE is given in Lemma 5.\\nThen, the origin (e, ˜Ka) = 0 of system (47), (49) is uniformly globally asymptotically stable (UGAS) and\\nuniformly locally exponentially stable (ULES).\\nNow that we have established that every solution e(t) converges exponentially to zero, uniformly from\\ncompact sets of initial conditions, we can conclude the convergence analysis by studying the identifier\\ndynamics (44).\\nLemma 7. Let the hypotheses of Lemma 5 hold and let γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nPE], where γ⋆\\nPE is given in Lemma\\n5. Then, the origin (˜ϵ, ˜A) = 0 of system (44), with input ξ(t), is uniformly globally exponentially stable\\n(UGES).\\nD. Proof of the Main Results\\n1) Proof of Theorem 1: Pick γ⋆ := min{γ⋆\\nb, γ⋆\\nPE} = γ⋆\\nPE, where γ⋆\\nb is from Proposition 1 and γ⋆\\nPE\\nis the one of Lemma 5. Then, if γ ≤ γ⋆, the closed-loop solutions are bounded and forward complete.\\nMoreover, xm is PE. The remainder of the proof involves showing the existence of a UGAS attractor\\nusing the concept of ω-limit set of a set, see [34, Def. 6.23].\\nBy Lemmas 6 and 7, from any compact set of initial conditions, it holds that ˆA → A, ˜ϵ → 0, e →\\n0, ˜Ka → 0 exponentially. Moreover, by Lemma 3, the model reference subsystem (46) is ISS with\\nuniformly bounded input d(t), in particular we have that:\\n|xm| ≥ Xm =⇒\\n˙Vm ≤ −q\\n4|xm|2,\\n(51)\\nwhere Xm can be found in (88) and depends on ∥d(·)∥∞, and Vm in (80) is an ISS Lyapunov function\\nfor the reference model. Consider the ξ subsystem in (19). It holds that\\n|ξ| ≥ 2|x|\\nλ\\n=⇒\\nd\\ndt\\n\\x121\\n2|ξ|2\\n\\x13\\n≤ −λ\\n2|ξ|2.\\n(52)\\nDenote Ξ := 2\\nλXm and define the compact set\\nK⋆\\ns := {(w, x, zs) ∈ W × Rn × Zs : ˆA = A, ˜ϵ = 0, e = 0, |xm| ≤ Xm, |ξ| ≤ Ξ} ⊂ W × Rn × Ls,\\n(53)\\nwhere Ls is the learning set given in (36). Consider a set of initial conditions Ks := K⋆\\ns + cB, with c > 0\\narbitrary, and note that the solutions are empty if they start outside W × Rn × Zs. We now prove that\\nK⋆\\ns is uniformly attractive from Ks. By the above-mentioned properties for the subsystems ˜A, ˜ϵ, e, ˜Ka, xm,\\nthere exists T ′ > 0 such that, for any ε > 0, it holds that\\n| ˜A(t)| ≤ ε,\\n|˜ϵ(t)| ≤ ε,\\n|e(t)| ≤ min\\n\\x12\\nε, λ\\n2\\nε\\n3\\n\\x13\\n,\\n|xm(t)| ≤ Xm + min\\n\\x12\\nε, λ\\n2\\nε\\n3\\n\\x13\\n.\\n(54)\\nfor all t ≥ T ′, from which it holds also that\\n2|x(t)|\\nλ\\n≤ 2\\nλ(|xm(t)| + |e(t)|)\\n≤ Ξ + ε\\n3 + ε\\n3 ≤ Ξ + 2\\n3ε.\\n(55)\\n14\\nThus, from (52), there exists T ≥ T ′ such that |ξ(t)| ≤ Ξ + ε for all t ≥ T.\\nFor compactness of notation, denote xs := (w, x, zs). The arguments above have proved that K⋆\\ns is\\nuniformly attractive from Ks. Namely, for any ρ > 0, there exists Tρ ≥ 0 such that |ϕ(t, xs)|K⋆s ≤ ρ, for\\nall t ≥ Tρ and xs ∈ Ks, where ϕ(t, xs) is the solution at time t of the closed-loop system having initial\\ncondition xs.\\nDenote with As := Ω(Ks) the ω-limit set of Ks. We want to prove that As ⊂ K⋆\\ns . We do it by\\ncontradiction, i.e., we suppose that As ⊂ K⋆\\ns is false. Under this hypothesis, there exists ¯xs ∈ As and\\nρ > 0 such that |¯xs|K⋆s ≥ 3ρ. By definition [34, Def. 6.23], the ω-limit set of Ks is the set of all points xs\\nsuch that there exist sequences xs,n ∈ Ks, tn ≥ 0 such that limn→∞ tn = ∞ and limn→∞ ϕ(tn, xs,n) = xs.\\nTherefore, by definition of limit, there exists ¯n ∈ N such that\\n|ϕ(tn, xs,n) − ¯xs| ≤ ρ,\\n∀n ≥ ¯n.\\n(56)\\nPick any subsequence xs,ni, tni such that, for ni ≥ ¯n, then tni ≥ Tρ, where Tρ derives from the uniform\\nattractivity of K⋆\\ns (see above). We have thus proved that, for ni ≥ ¯n, |ϕ(tni, xs,ni) − ¯xs| ≤ ρ, thus\\n|ϕ(tni, xs,ni)|K⋆s ≥ 2ρ, and at the same time |ϕ(tni, xs,ni)|K⋆s ≤ ρ by uniform attractivity of K⋆\\ns . This is a\\ncontradiction, hence necessarily As ⊂ K⋆\\ns .\\nTo summarize the previous results, we have thus proved that the solutions are globally bounded and\\nforward complete and\\nAs := Ω(Ks) ⊂ K⋆\\ns ⊂ Int(Ks) ⊂ Ks.\\n(57)\\nBy [34, Corollary 7.7], As = Ω(Ks) is asymptotically stable, with domain of attraction containing Ks.\\nSince Ks can be chosen arbitrarily large due to Proposition 1, we conclude UGAS of As.\\n2) Proof of Theorem 2: Consider the reduced-order system with state xs := (w, x, zs) and the boundary\\nlayer system with state ˆP. Define the indicator functions\\nωs(xs) :=\\n(\\n|xs|As\\nxs ∈ W × Rn × Zs\\n∞\\nelsewhere\\nωf(xs, ˆP) :=\\n(\\n| ˆP − P( ˆA)|\\n(xs, ˆP) ∈ W × Rn × Z\\n∞\\nelsewhere.\\n(58)\\nBy Theorem 1, the reduced-order system satisfies\\nωs(xs(t)) ≤ βs(ωs(xs(0)), t),\\n(59)\\nwhere βs is a class KL function. Moreover, by the DRE properties [37, Thm. 4], the boundary-layer\\nsystem d ˆP/dτ(τ) = R( ˆP(τ), ˆA), with ˆA ∈ Θ constant and τ := gt, satisfies\\nωf(xs, ˆP(τ)) ≤ βf(ωf(xs, ˆP(0)), τ),\\n(60)\\nwhere βf is a class KL function. From [42, Thm. 1] (Assumptions 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 can be verified), from any\\ncompact set of initial conditions K ⊂ W × Rn × Z and for any δ > 0, there exists g⋆ > 0 such that, for\\nall g ≥ g⋆, the solutions are forward complete and satisfy:\\nωs(xs(t)) ≤ βs(ωs(xs(0)), t) + δ\\nωf(xs(t), ˆP(t)) ≤ βf(ωf(xs(0), ˆP(0)), gt) + δ.\\n(61)\\nIn particular, choose K := As × P ⋆ + cB, with c > 0 arbitrary. Reference model dynamics (22) can be\\nrewritten as:\\n˙xm =( ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)xm + Bd\\n=(A − BR−1B⊤P ⋆)xm + Bd + ( ˜A − BR−1B⊤( ˆP − P ⋆))xm\\n=(A − BR−1B⊤P ⋆)xm + Bd + ( ˜A − BR−1B⊤( ˆP − P( ˆA) + P( ˆA) − P(A)))xm.\\n(62)\\n15\\nNotice that xm is PE if ˆP = P( ˆA) and ˜A = 0. Furthermore, since P( ˆA) is an analytic function of ˆA, xm\\nis PE by [43, Lemma 6.1.2] if | ˆP − P( ˆA)| and | ˜A| are sufficiently small, because the solutions of (62)\\nare sufficiently close to those with ˆP = P( ˆA) and ˜A = 0. Moreover, also x and ξ are PE if xm is PE and\\n|e| is sufficiently small. Choose δ > 0 such that the conditions ωs(xs) ≤ 2δ and ωf(xs, ˆP) ≤ 2δ imply\\nthat xm, x, and ξ are PE. Then, pick g ≥ g⋆, where g⋆ is obtained from the considered K and δ. From\\n(61), the closed-loop solutions converge in finite time T to a compact set satisfying ωs(xs) ≤ 2δ and\\nωf(xs, ˆP) ≤ 2δ. Then, for t ≥ T, ˜ϵ → 0, ˆA → A exponentially from Lemma 7 since ξ is PE. From the\\nlocal exponential stability of the DRE [37, Thm. 4], it follows that ˆP → P ⋆ exponentially. By Lemma 6\\nand ˆP → P( ˆA), we conclude that e → 0, ˆKa → 0 exponentially. As a consequence, the same arguments\\nof Theorem 1 (omitted here to avoid repetition) can be used to show that the compact set\\nK⋆ := {(xs, ˆP) ∈ W × Rn × Z : ˆA = A, ˜ϵ = 0, e = 0, |xm| ≤ Xm, |ξ| ≤ Ξ, ˆP = P ⋆}\\n= K⋆\\ns × P ⋆,\\n(63)\\nis uniformly attractive from K, with K⋆\\ns given in (53) . The same steps as in Theorem 1 allow to prove\\nthat A := Ω(K) ⊂ K⋆ ⊂ Int(K) ⊂ K, thus A is uniformly asymptotically stable with domain of attraction\\ncontaining K, and since K can be chosen arbitrarily large we can conclude semiglobal uniform asymptotic\\nstability of A.\\nFinally, we want to prove that A = As × P ⋆, where As = Ω(K⋆\\ns). In A, it holds that ˆP = P ⋆, ˆA = A\\nand ˜ϵ = 0, from which it holds that ˆP = P( ˆA) = P(A) = P ⋆ for all points in this set. For this reason,\\nin A, the vector field of Algorithm 1 coincides with the vector field of the reduced-order system with\\nˆA = A and ˜ϵ = 0. Since the vector fields coincide, we have that in this set solutions x(t) of Algorithm 1\\ncan be written as x(t) = xs(t) × P ⋆, where xs(t) is the solution of the reduced-order system having the\\nsame initial conditions.\\nFrom (63) and A ⊂ K⋆, it follows that A = Ω(K) = Ω(K⋆) = Ω(K⋆\\ns × P ⋆) = A′ × P ⋆. Since for the\\nslow states of Algorithm 1 the solutions coincide with those of the reduced-order system, it follows that\\nA′ = As. As a consequence, A = As × P ⋆.\\nVI. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS: CONTROL OF A DOUBLY FED INDUCTION MOTOR\\nIn this section, we propose two numerical examples to show the effectiveness of Model Reference\\nAdaptive Reinforcement Learning. In the first example, we consider the model of a doubly fed induction\\nmotor (DFIM) at constant speed with unknown rotor and stator resistances. In the second example, we\\ntest the robustness of the proposed algorithm by considering a DFIM with slowly time-varying unknown\\nresistances, due to the motor heating up, and rotor acceleration.\\nA.

We suppose to have uncertainties on the parameters R1 and R2. This makes the matrix A\\nuncertain in half of its entries.

Next, in Fig. 4-(b), we show how\\nthe data-driven feedback gain approaches the optimal one. Since in this simulation we have a LTV plant,\\nwe calculate at each time instant the optimal gain K⋆(t) by solving an LQR problem with constant A(t).\\nThe importance of the adaptive controller action is particularly clear in presence of the speed disturbance,\\nwhere the estimated matrix is far from the true one and thus the optimal action is likely to be destabilizing.\\nFinally, we show in Fig. 5 how the error between the reference model and the real plant is kept bounded\\nalso in the presence of these disturbances.\\n19\\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n-6\\n-4\\n-2\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\nFig. 5.

CONCLUSIONS\\nIn this paper, we have addressed the problem of data-driven optimal control of partially unknown linear\\nsystems. First, we have proposed a framework that formalizes a robustlty stable on-policy data-driven\\nLQR problem in which optimality of the learned strategy is obtained while guaranteeing robust stability\\nof the whole learning and control closed-loop system. Next, we have proposed a new solution to this\\nproblem consisting in the combination of model reference adaptive control and reinforcement learning.\\nAs main result, we showed that our design has a semiglobally uniformly asymptotically stable attractor\\nwhere the plant follows the optimal reference model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution, we\\ntested it in the control of a doubly fed induction motor. The results show that our solution is also able to\\nmanage non-vanishing perturbations typical of real-world applications.\\nVIII. APPENDIX\\nA. Proofs\\nProof of Lemma 1. At first, to simplify the expressions for the Lyapunov function, we introduce the\\nfollowing vectorized coordinates:\\nˆθA := vec( ˆA) ∈ Rn2,\\n˜θA := vec( ˜A) ∈ Rn2.\\n(72)\\nIt can be verified the following relation holds:\\nvec(BB†ϵξ⊤) = ¯B(ξ ⊗ In)ϵ,\\n¯B := (In ⊗ BB†),\\n(73)\\nwhere ¯B defines a projection onto Im(In ⊗B) ⊂ Rn2. Notice that, for any ˆθA ∈ Im(In ⊗B) and τ ∈ Rn2,\\nthen ˜θA ∈ Im(In ⊗ B) and, since the scalar product of orthogonal vectors is zero and by idempotence of\\nthe projection,\\n˜θ⊤\\nAτ = ˜θ⊤\\nA(τ∥ + τ⊥) = ˜θ⊤\\nAτ∥ + 0 = ˜θ⊤\\nA ¯Bτ∥ = ˜θ⊤\\nA ¯B(τ∥ + τ⊥) = ˜θ⊤\\nA ¯Bτ,\\n(74)\\nwhere τ∥ ∈ Im(In ⊗ B) and τ⊥ ∈ (In ⊗ B)⊥. We rewrite (20) by using the vectorized coordinates defined\\nabove:\\n˙ˆθA =\\nProj\\nvec−1 ˆθA∈C\\n\\x1a\\n−γ ¯B (ξ ⊗ In)ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n\\x1b\\n.\\n(75)\\nThe computations from here are similar to [40, Lemma 6.1] but we report them for the reader’s conve-\\nnience. Define\\nVA(˜ϵ, ˜θA) := 1\\nλ|˜ϵ|2 + 1\\n2γ |˜θA|2,\\n(76)\\n20\\nwhich is positive definite with respect to (0, 0) and radially unbounded. Note that ϵ = (ξ ⊗ In)⊤˜θA + ˜ϵ.\\nThen, using (74) and [40, Lemma E.1] to treat the projection operator Proj ˆ\\nA∈C{·}, the derivative of VA\\nalong the solutions of (44) is\\n˙VA = −2|˜ϵ|2 + ˜θ⊤\\nA\\nProj\\nvec−1 ˆθA∈C\\n\\x1a\\n− ¯B (ξ ⊗ In)ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n\\x1b\\n≤ −2|˜ϵ|2 −\\n˜θ⊤\\nA ¯B(ξ ⊗ In)ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n= −2|˜ϵ|2 −\\n˜θ⊤\\nA(ξ ⊗ In)ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n≤ −2|˜ϵ|2 − |ϵ|2 − ˜ϵ⊤ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ|2\\n≤ −2|˜ϵ|2 − 1\\n4\\n|ϵ|2\\n(1 + ν|ξ|2)2 +\\n˜ϵ⊤ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ|2 − 3\\n4\\n|ϵ|2\\n1 + ν|ξ|2\\n= −|˜ϵ|2 −\\n\\x121\\n2\\n|ϵ|\\n1 + ν|ξ|2 − ˜ϵ\\n\\x132\\n− 3\\n4\\n|ϵ|2\\n1 + ν|ξ|2 ≤ 0\\n(77)\\nimplying that (˜ϵ(t), ˜θA(t)) is contained for all t ∈ [0, tf) in a compact sublevel set of VA. We conclude\\nthe proof by recalling [40, Lemma E.1] to ensure ˆA(t) ∈ Θ, for all its domain of existence.\\nProof of Lemma 2. Using [40, Lemma E.1] to treat the projection operator Proj ˆ\\nA∈C{·} and the fact that\\n| ¯B| = 1 due to (73), we can bound | ˙ˆA| as follows:\\n| ˙ˆA| ≤ | ˙ˆA|F = | ˙ˆθA| ≤ γ| ¯B||(ξ ⊗ In)||ϵ|\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ| ≤\\nγ|ξ||ϵ|\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ| ≤ γ.\\n(78)\\nProof of Lemma 3. Function P( ˆA) being continuous and Θ a compact set, there exist scalars pmin, pmax > 0\\nsuch that\\npminIn ≤ P( ˆA) ≤ pmaxIn,\\n∀ ˆA ∈ Θ.\\n(79)\\nThen, define the Lyapunov function\\nVm(xm, t) := xm\\n⊤P( ˆA)xm\\n(80)\\nwhich is positive definite and radially unbounded, and whose derivative along the solutions of (22) is\\ngiven by:\\n˙Vm = xm\\n⊤ \\x10\\nP( ˆA)Acl( ˆA) +Acl( ˆA)\\n⊤P( ˆA)\\n\\x11\\nxm + xm\\n⊤\\n \\n∂P( ˆA)\\n∂ ˆA\\n⊙ ˙ˆA\\n!\\nxm + 2xm\\n⊤P( ˆA)Bd,\\n(81)\\nwhere\\nAcl( ˆA) := ˆA − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA)\\n(82)\\nand the product ⊙ is defined as\\n∂P( ˆA)\\n∂ ˆA\\n⊙ ˙ˆA =\\nn\\nX\\ni=1\\nn\\nX\\nj=1\\n∂P( ˆA)\\n∂[ ˆA]ij\\n[ ˙ˆA]ij,\\n(83)\\nwith [ ˆA]ij the i-th row and j-th column entry of matrix ˆA. Since ˆP = P( ˆA) solves at each time instant\\nARE (27), it holds that:\\nAcl( ˆA)P( ˆA)+P( ˆA)Acl( ˆA) =−Q−K( ˆA)\\n⊤RK( ˆA)\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\n=:− ¯Q( ˆ\\nA)\\n,\\n(84)\\n21\\nwhere from Assumption 1 and Θ being compact, ¯Q( ˆA) ≥ q > 0 for all ˆA ∈ Θ, with q defined as\\nq := min\\nˆ\\nA∈Θ λmin\\n\\x10\\n−Q − P( ˆA)BRB⊤P( ˆA)\\n\\x11\\n,\\n(85)\\nwhere λmin(·) denotes the smallest eigenvalue of a matrix.

At first, to simplify the expressions for the Lyapunov function, we introduce the\\nfollowing vectorized coordinates:\\nˆθa := vec( ˆKa) ∈ Rmn,\\n˜θa := vec( ˜Ka) ∈ Rmn.\\n(89)\\nWe rewrite dynamics (47) and (49) by using the vectorized coordinates above defined:\\n˙e = Acl( ˆA)e + B ˆKax − BKa( ˆA)x\\n= Acl( ˆA)e + B(x ⊗ Im)⊤˜θa,\\n˙˜θa = −µ(x ⊗ Im)B⊤P( ˆA)e.\\n(90)\\nConsider the Lyapunov function\\nVe(e, ˜θa, t) := e⊤P( ˆA)e + 1\\nµ|˜θa|2,\\n(91)\\nwhich is positive definite and radially unbounded. The time derivative of Ve along the trajectories of (90)\\nis given by\\n˙Ve = e⊤\\n \\nP( ˆA)Acl( ˆA) + Acl( ˆA)\\n⊤P( ˆA) + ∂P( ˆA)\\n∂ ˆA\\n⊙ ˙ˆA\\n!\\ne\\n+ 2e⊤P( ˆA)B(x ⊗ Im)⊤˜θa − 2\\nµ\\n˜θ⊤\\na (µ(x ⊗ Im)B⊤P( ˆA)e)\\n= − e⊤\\n \\n¯Q( ˆA) − ∂P( ˆA)\\n∂ ˆA\\n⊙ ˙ˆA\\n!\\ne ≤ −q\\n2|e|2 ≤ 0,\\n(92)\\n22\\nwhere Acl( ˆA) is defined in (82), ¯Q( ˆA) is given in (84), and q is found in (85). We have ensured that\\n(e(t), ˜θa(t)) is contained for all t ∈ [0, tf) in a compact sublevel set of Ve, thus concluding the proof.\\nProof of Lemma 5. For all ˆA ∈ Θ, pair (Acl( ˆA), B) in (46), with Acl( ˆA) given in (82), is controllable\\nbecause ( ˆA, B) is controllable from Assumption (1). Additionally, the origin of system ˙xm = Acl( ˆA)xm\\nis UGES from Lemma 3.\\nFrom classical results on PE [31, §5.6.4], if ˙ˆA = 0 then xm(t) is PE, i.e, there exist T > 0, α > 0 such\\nthat\\nZ t+T\\nt\\nxm(s)xm(s)⊤ds ≥ αIn,\\n∀t ≥ 0.\\n(93)\\nBy [45, Thm. 6.1], there exist a constant scalar η > 0, such that, if\\n|Acl( ˆA(s)) − Acl( ˆA(τ))| ≤ η,\\n∀s, τ ∈ [t, t + T],\\n(94)\\nfor all t ≥ 0, then xm(t) is PE also when ˙ˆA ̸= 0. Recall that Acl( ˆA) := ˆA − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA) is an analytic\\nfunction of ˆA [41, Thm. 4.1]. Thus, from the mean-value theorem and similar computations to (86), we\\nobtain:\\n|Acl( ˆA(s)) − Acl( ˆA(τ))| =\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c(s − τ)∂Acl( ˆA)\\n∂ ˆA\\n⊙ ˙ˆA(ς)\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n≤ |s − τ|cn\\n3\\n2| ˙ˆA(ς)|,\\n(95)\\nwhere ς ∈ [s, τ], c := maxi,j∈{1,...,n}\\nn\\nmax ˆ\\nA∈Θ\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c ∂Acl( ˆ\\nA)\\n∂[ ˆ\\nA]ij\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\no\\n. From the fact that | ˙ˆA(·)| ≤ γ, we conclude that\\nfor γ⋆\\nPE := η/(Tcn\\n3\\n2), if γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nPE], then bound η in (94) is enforced and thus xm(t) is PE.\\nProof of Lemma 6. From Lemma 4 and the solutions being forward complete, it holds that the origin\\n(e, ˜θa) = 0 of system (90) is UGS. Note that the regressor in (49) is given by x(t). Therefore, if x(t) is\\nuniformly PE (u-PE) as in [35, Def. 5], then UGAS and ULES of (e, ˜θa) = 0 follows from [35, Thm. 1\\nand 2]. To prove u-PE of x(t), note that x(t) = xm(t)+e(t), where xm(t) is PE from Lemma 5. Therefore,\\nwe conclude u-PE of x(t) from [35, Prop. 2].\\nProof of Lemma 7. From Lemma 1 and UGES of the ˜ϵ subsystem, we only need to prove UGES of\\nsystem (44) with ˜ϵ = 0, which we write here in vectorized coordinates:\\n˙˜θA =\\nProj\\nvec−1 ˆθA∈C\\n(\\n−γ ¯B (ξ ⊗ In)(ξ ⊗ In)⊤˜θA\\n1 + ν|ξ|| ˜Aξ|\\n)\\n.\\n(96)\\nSince the directions where learning happens are unchanged by the projection operator and by ¯B, we\\nare interested in studying regressor ¯ξ(t) :=\\nξ(t)⊗In\\n√\\n1+ν|ξ(t)|| ˜\\nA(t)ξ(t)| in order to prove our result. Given a small\\nenough gain γ, it holds from Lemma 5 that xm(t) is PE, while e(t) → 0 exponentially fast from Lemma\\n6. From (45), ξ(t) is a filtered version of the PE signal xm(t) + e(t), thus ξ(t) is PE [31, Lemma. 4.8.3].\\nSince all signals are bounded and (ξ ⊗ In)(ξ ⊗ In)⊤ = (ξξ⊤) ⊗ In, PE of ξ(t) implies that\\nZ t+T\\nt\\n¯ξ(s)¯ξ(s)⊤ds ≥\\nZ t+T\\nt\\n(ξ(s)ξ(s)⊤) ⊗ In\\n1 + ξ2\\nM ˜AM\\nds ≥ αIn2,\\n(97)\\nfor some T, α > 0 and all t ∈ R≥0, with ξM := supt∈R |ξ(t)|, ˜AM := supt∈R | ˜A(t)|, thus ¯ξ(t) is PE. From\\n[31, Thm. 8.5.6], we conclude that ˜A = 0 is UGES.\\n23\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] M. Borghesi, A. Bosso, and G.

INTRODUCTION\\nR\\nEINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL) is a machine learning field that emerged to perform optimiza-\\ntion and decision-making by interacting with an environment without or with limited knowledge of\\nits mathematical model [2], [3]. Over the past years, this field has been successfully applied to multiple\\ndomains, including computer games, biology, and economics and finance. RL has garnered the attention\\nof the control engineering community, where it has been used to address optimal control in uncertain\\nor model-free scenarios. Learning from system data aligns RL with principles found in adaptive control\\nliterature [4], which seeks to design dynamic controllers for regulation and tracking in the presence of\\nmodel uncertainties. This work systematically investigates the connection between the fields of optimal\\nand adaptive control, paving the way for a new RL paradigm that provides formal certificates of robust\\nclosed-loop learning and control, thereby leading to effective performance in real-world applications.\\nIn particular, we focus on solving the infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem by\\ndeveloping an on-policy data-driven algorithm where data collection and optimization are done simul-\\ntaneously by applying the learned policy to the actual system. The requirements of our framework are\\nschematically presented below in Table I and later formalized in Section II. A key distinctive feature\\nof our proposed framework is the requirement of robust asymptotic stability for the whole closed-loop\\nsystem including both the learning and control dynamics. This requirement, as elucidated in the subsequent\\nsections, encapsulates the notion that the proven learning features in nominal cases must persist in perturbed\\nscenarios, encompassing disturbances, measurement noise, slowly varying parameters, and sample-and-\\nhold implementations. With a priori guarantees of effective closed-loop controller implementation, our\\nframework is particularly tailored for safety-critical applications, such as collaborative robotics and aircraft\\ncontrol. Motivated by the above discussion, we provide an overview of the literature pertaining to data-\\ndriven LQR, distinguishing between both so-called off-policy and on-policy approaches. Then, we recall\\nmodel reference adaptive control, one of the main inspirations of the approach of this article.\\nM. Borghesi, A. Bosso, and G. Notarstefano are with the Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, Alma Mater\\nStudiorum - Universit`a di Bologna, 40136 Bologna, Italy. The corresponding author is M. Borghesi (e-mail: m.borghesi@unibo.it).\\nA preliminary version of this work is given in [1].\\narXiv:2402.14483v1  [eess.SY]  22 Feb 2024\\n2\\nTABLE I Robustly stable on-policy data-driven LQR\\nPlant:\\n˙x = Ax + Bu,\\n(1)\\nwith state x ∈ Rn, input u ∈ Rm, and matrices A and B.\\nInfinite-horizon LQR: find an optimal control policy π⋆ : Rn → Rm such that u(t) = π⋆(x(t))\\nminimizes, for all initial conditions x0 ∈ Rn, the following cost functional along the solutions of the\\nplant:\\nJ(x0, u(·)):=\\nZ ∞\\n0\\nx(τ)⊤Qx(τ) + u(τ)⊤Ru(τ)dτ,\\n(2)\\nwith tuning matrices Q = Q⊤ ≥ 0, R = R⊤ > 0.\\nProblem: with A and B partially or totally unknown, find a controller of the form\\n˙z = φ(x, z, d)\\nlearning dynamics\\nu = π(x, z, d)\\napplied control policy\\n(3)\\nwith z ∈ Z ⊂ Rℓ and d ∈ Rq a dither signal, such that the following properties are achieved.\\n1) Exploration: d probes the uncertainties of A and B.\\n2) Exploitation: map x 7→ π(x, z, 0) converges to the optimal policy x 7→ π⋆(x).\\n3) Robust stability: learning is enforced through robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system.\\nOff-Policy Data-Driven LQR: Off-policy approaches involve finding the optimal policy without applying\\nit at the same time to the actual system. In this context, we find iterative methods, often inspired by the\\nKleinman algorithm, involving either parameter identification or direct estimate of the policy [5]–[11].\\nTypically, in these methods, the stabilization of the controlled system during the evolution of the learning\\nalgorithm is circumvented by assuming an initial stabilizing policy. However, as discussed in [12], there\\nare situations where this assumption may be unrealistic due to plant uncertainties. The algorithm [13]\\ndoes not need this assumption. Finally, other relevant paradigms for off-policy approaches involve batch\\nidentification of the policy from data [14]–[19] and system-level synthesis [20]. All these approaches\\ndiffer from our setup, since the exploration and exploitation phases are not performed simultaneously.\\nOn-Policy Data-Driven LQR: As compared to off-policy approaches, the on-policy paradigm adds the\\nsignificant challenge of ensuring stability of the interconnection between the plant and the control/learning\\nalgorithm. Early attempts to address this setup are [21]–[27], where the stabilizing feedback gain is updated\\nat discrete iterations. However, the stability of the whole closed-loop system is not analyzed and an initial\\nstabilizing policy is required, similar to off-policy approaches. A data-driven approach to compute the\\ninitial gain is presented in [28]. To the best of our knowledge, [29] is the only work in the literature\\nthat provides stability guarantees without a stabilizing initialization, although the focus is on the learning\\ndynamics and not the overall closed-loop system.\\nModel Reference Adaptive Control: We finally review the literature dealing with model reference\\nadaptive control (MRAC). The principle of this technique is to match the unknown system dynamics\\nto a reference model with desired properties [30]–[32]. To ensure design feasibility, this stabilization\\ntechnique requires the plant to satisfy constraints named matching conditions. A recent work combining\\nMRAC and RL is [33], where RL techniques are used to find the optimal controller for a reference model\\nbased on nominal plant parameters. Then, MRAC is applied to assign the reference model to the real\\nsystem. However, convergence to the desired policy is not proved and can only be ensured to a policy\\nthat is optimal for the reference model and not the true system.\\nArticle Contribution: The goal of this article is to lay the foundations for a new paradigm of on-policy\\ndata-driven LQR according to the problem setting described in Table I. The main paper contribution is\\ntwofold: (i) introducing a novel formulation of the on-policy data-driven LQR problem where centrality\\nis given to the stability of the whole closed-loop learning and control system; (ii) providing a combined\\n3\\nadaptive control and reinforcement learning design paradigm to address this framework.\\nConcerning our first contribution, we formulate the on-policy data-driven LQR problem in terms of\\nconvergence of the controller, the plant, and an exosystem (modeling the dither signal) to an asymptotically\\nstable set. The fundamental property defining this set is that the learned policy is optimal. Additionally,\\nthe set becomes smaller as the dither amplitude is reduced. Thanks to this formulation, we ensure that\\nasymptotic stability in the nominal scenario is preserved, practically and semiglobally, also for a broad\\nclass of perturbations, see [34, Ch. 7]. With the generality of the proposed framework, we aim to provide\\na solid foundation for future work in the field.\\nThe second and main contribution of this work consists in introducing an on-policy learning and\\ncontrol law, termed Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (MR-ARL), integrating concepts\\nfrom system identification, adaptive control, and reinforcement learning paradigms. The architecture is\\nstructured as a modular actor-critic system with a time-varying reference model bridging the two modules.\\nThe actor, inspired to a MRAC architecture, guides the plant to a desired behavior set by the reference\\nmodel, even in the presence of parametric uncertainties. The reference model is updated online by the\\ncritic, which leverages system identification techniques to estimate the dynamics. To impose the desired\\nlearning properties, the reference model is driven by a dither signal for which we require suitable richness\\nproperties. By relying on analysis tools related to adaptive control, differential inclusions, and singular\\nperturbations, we prove formally that our architecture achieves the following properties for the whole\\nclosed-loop system: (i) convergence of the policy to the optimal one; (ii) asymptotic estimation of the true\\nsystem parameters; (iii) uniform asymptotic stability of an attractor (tunable with the dither amplitude); (iv)\\nrobustness in the sense of semiglobal practical asymptotic stability with respect to unmodeled nonlinearities\\nand disturbances. To the best of authors’ knowledge, in the context of on-policy data-driven LQR, this\\nalgorithm is the first one possessing all these properties. Also, no assumptions are needed about the initial\\npolicy. Further, persistency of excitation, needed to ensure convergence, is not assumed a priori, but rather\\nguaranteed by design by resorting to concepts from nonlinear adaptive systems [35]. Finally, given the\\ninherent robustness of the proposed design framework, we ensure that the algorithm is effective in the\\npresence of slowly varying parameters. To validate this property, our numerical simulations cover both\\nthe constant parameters case and the one with drifts.\\nIn Section II, we provide preliminary concepts of LQR and introduce the on-policy data-driven paradigm\\nthat formalizes Table I. Then, Section III presents MR-ARL and its derivation, while Section IV provides\\nits stability properties. The technical results for the stability analysis are given in Section V, while all\\nrelated proofs are left in the Appendix. Finally, Section VI provides in-depth numerical results.\\nNotation: The set of real numbers is denoted by R, while R≥0 := [0, +∞).

PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM SETUP\\nFollowing the discussion in the introduction, we now provide a rigorous formulation of the on-policy\\ndata-driven linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem addressed in the paper.\\nA. Linear Quadratic Regulation\\nWe start by introducing the basic concepts of LQR for system (1) and the cost functional (2). The infinite-\\nhorizon LQR problem involves finding a control policy π⋆ : Rn → Rm such that applying u(t) = π⋆(x(t))\\n4\\nfor all t ∈ R≥0 solves, for all initial conditions x0 ∈ Rn, the following optimal control problem:\\nmin\\nu(·) J(x0, u(·)) :=\\nZ ∞\\n0\\nx(τ)⊤Qx(τ) + u(τ)⊤Ru(τ)dτ\\nsubject to:\\n˙x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),\\n∀t ∈ R≥0,\\nx(0) = x0.\\n(4)\\nUnder the assumption that pair (A, B) be stabilizable and (√Q, A) be detectable, the LQR problem (4)\\nis solved by the linear policy:\\nπ⋆(x) := K⋆x,\\nK⋆ := −R−1B⊤P ⋆,\\n(5)\\nwhere P ⋆ ∈ Sn\\n0 is the unique solution of the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE):\\nA⊤P ⋆ + P ⋆A − P ⋆BR−1B⊤P ⋆ + Q = 0.\\n(6)\\nAdditionally, P ⋆ ∈ Sn\\n+ if pair (√Q, A) is observable. We also recall that P ⋆ specifies the value function,\\nwhich is defined, for a given initial condition x, as the minimum of J(x, u(·)):\\nV ⋆(x) := min\\nu(·) J(x, u(·)) := x⊤P ⋆x.\\n(7)\\nConsider the differential Riccati equation (DRE) with flow set constrained to symmetric positive semidef-\\ninite matrices:\\n˙P = A⊤P + PA − PBR−1B⊤P + Q,\\nP ∈ Sn\\n0 .\\n(8)\\nThen, if (A, B) is stabilizable and (√Q, A) is detectable, the equilibrium point P ⋆ is uniformly globally\\nasymptotically stable (UGAS) for the constrained differential equation (8) [36, Thm. 15]. Furthermore, if\\n(A, B) is controllable and (√Q, A) is observable, P ⋆ is uniformly locally exponentially stable (ULES)\\n[37, Thm. 4]. Formal results describing the stability properties of DRE (8) are provided in [36], [37].\\nB. Robustly Stable On-Policy Data-Driven LQR\\nSolving the LQR problem (4) involves computing the solution P ⋆ of ARE (5), which depends on the\\nmatrices A and B of plant (1). Therefore, if A and B are unknown or only partially known, it is necessary\\nto resort to data-driven approaches based on acquiring the data of the state-input sequences (x(t), u(t))\\n(continuously or via batches).\\nIn this work, we are interested in finding an on-policy data-driven algorithm, where data collection and\\nlearning are performed simultaneously by applying the learned policy. We now provide a novel rigorous\\nframework to formalize this problem so that its solution guarantees, by design, desirable learning and\\nrobust stability properties.\\nAs anticipated in the introduction, the class of controllers that we seek are described by continuous-time\\ndynamical systems of the form\\n˙z = φ(x, z, d)\\nu = π(x, z, d)\\nz ∈ Z,\\n(9)\\nwhere z is the controller state, Z ⊂ Rℓ is a closed set, d ∈ Rq is a uniformly bounded signal, named\\nhereafter dither, while φ and π are maps that are locally Lipschitz in their arguments. To the algorithm\\n(9), we associate the learning set L, defined as:\\nL := {z ∈ Z : π(x, z, 0) = K⋆x, ∀x ∈ Rn},\\n(10)\\nwhich denotes the set of all controller states such that the control policy π coincides with the optimal\\npolicy π⋆ in (5) whenever the dither d is turned off.\\n5\\nIn (9), d is an exogenous signal that may include references for tracking, probing signals, or disturbances.\\nTo ensure well-posedness of the problem formulation, from now on we consider a general class of signals\\nd that can be generated by an autonomous dynamical system (exosystem) of the form\\n˙w = s(w)\\nd = h(w)\\nw ∈ W,\\n(11)\\nwhere w is the exosystem state, W ⊂ Rp is the set of admissible initial conditions w(0), while s and h\\nare locally Lipschitz maps. Since d is a bounded signal defined for all t ∈ R≥0, we suppose that the set\\nW be compact and strongly forward invariant under the flow of (11).\\nRemark 1. Exosystem (11) is not implemented in the control solution but is used to represent the class\\nof admissible signals d. Moreover, the results of the paper hold if (11) is replaced by a well-posed hybrid\\ndynamical system [34] to include discontinuous dither signals. Here, we use a continuous-time exosystem\\nto avoid an additional notational burden.\\nThe closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of exosystem (11), plant (1), and controller\\n(9) is given by\\n˙w = s(w)\\n˙x = Ax + Bπ(x, z, h(w))\\n˙z = φ(x, z, h(w))\\n(w, x, z) ∈ W × Rn × Z.\\n(12)\\nWe are ready to precisely state the requirements for controller (9), which include a precise stability\\ncharacterization for the closed-loop system (12).\\nDefinition 1. We say that controller (9) solves the robustly stable on-policy data-driven LQR problem if\\nthe learning set L in (10) is non-empty and, for a chosen class of dither signals d generated by exosystem\\n(11), there exists a compact attractor A, satisfying\\nA ⊂ W × Rn × L,\\n(13)\\nthat is asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system (12).\\nWe show that any algorithm satisfying Definition 1 covers all of the design requirements stated in the\\nintroduction.\\n• Exploration: choosing the dither d determines the shape and the attractivity properties of A, thus it\\nensures the necessary probing to estimate the optimal policy.\\n• Exploitation: since the projection of A in the z direction is a subset of the learning set L, uniform\\nattractivity of A (encoded in asymptotic stability) ensures z → L and, thus, correct estimation of the\\noptimal policy.\\n• Robust stability: under the regularity properties required for the controller and assumed for the\\nexosystem, asymptotic stability of the attractor A is preserved (practically and semiglobally) under\\na broad range of non-vanishing perturbations arising in real-world scenarios, such as disturbances,\\nmeasurement noise, unmodeled dynamics, sample-and-hold implementations of the controller, and\\nactuator dynamics.\\nRemark 2. In Definition 1, we do not specify the restrictions on the knowledge of A and B to cover a\\nbroad range of applications and solutions. However, the prior knowledge on the parametric uncertainties\\ndetermines the design of φ, π, and Z. Note that, if controller (9) is not appropriately chosen, the learning\\nset may be empty.\\nRemark 3. The convergence of z to the learning set L in Definition 1 implies that the controlled plant\\nbecomes asymptotically:\\n˙x = (A + BK⋆)x + ∆(x, z, d),\\n(14)\\n6\\nModel Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning\\nACTOR\\nCRITIC\\nPlant\\nx\\nReference model\\nxm\\nAdaptive stabilizer\\nˆKa\\nValue function identifier\\nξ, ζ, ˆA, ˆP\\nx\\nxm, d\\nˆA, ˆP\\nu\\nExosystem\\nw\\nd\\nFig. 1. Block scheme of the Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning.\\nwhere ∆(x, z, d) := B(π(x, z, d)−K⋆x) vanishes in d = 0. Moreover, since ∆(x, z, d) is locally Lipschitz,\\nit is uniformly bounded for all (x, z, w) in the compact attractor A. As a consequence, the input-to-state\\nstability of (14) implies that\\nlim sup\\nt→∞\\n|x(t)| ≤ α(lim sup\\nt→∞\\n|d(t)|),\\n(15)\\nwhere α is a class K function. In other words, the ultimate bound of x directly depends on the amplitude\\nof the injected dither d.\\nIII. MODEL REFERENCE ADAPTIVE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\\nWe now present a new control and learning approach, named Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement\\nLearning (MR-ARL), which satisfies Definition 1 in a scenario of structured uncertainties characterized\\nby the following assumptions.\\nAssumption 1. There exists a known closed convex set C ⊂ Rn×n such that:\\n1) C has a non-empty interior and A ∈ Int(C);\\n2) ( ˆA, B) is controllable and (√Q, ˆA) is observable for all ˆA ∈ C.\\nRemark 4. From [29], [38], it is known that if there exists A0 such that (A0, B) is controllable and\\n(√Q, A0) is observable, then there exists a scalar ρ > 0 such that (A, B) is controllable and (√Q, A) is\\nobservable for all A such that |A − A0| ≤ ρ. Therefore, during implementation, the set C can be chosen\\nas a ball centered in a nominal value A0 of A with radius ρ chosen to include all possible uncertainties.\\nAssumption 2. Consider the linear map B : K ∈ Rm×n 7−→ BK ∈ Rn×n, where B is the input matrix\\nin (1). For some known A0 ∈ C, it holds that\\nA0 − A ∈ Im(B).\\n(16)\\nRemark 5. Assumption 2 is an alternative formulation of the matching conditions used in the MRAC\\nliterature [30]. Notice that for any ˆA such that ˆA−A0 ∈ Im(B), by ˆA−A0+(A0−A) = ˆA−A ∈ Im(B),\\nthere exists Ka ∈ Rm×n such that\\nˆA − A = BKa.\\n(17)\\n7\\nAlgorithm 1 MR-ARL\\nInitialization:\\nˆP(0) ∈ Sn\\n0 , ˆA(0) ∈ Θ, with Θ from Remark 5\\nλ, γ, ν, g, µ > 0 design gains\\nd(t): bounded and stationary signal with each entry sufficiently rich of order n + 1 and uncorrelated\\nRepeat:\\nSwapping filters:\\n˙ξ = −λξ + x,\\n˙ζ = −λ(x + ζ) − Bu\\n(19)\\nIdentifier dynamics:\\n˙ˆA = Proj\\nˆ\\nA∈C\\n\\x1a\\n−γBB†\\nϵξ⊤\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n\\x1b\\n,\\nϵ := ˆAξ−(x + ζ)\\n(20)\\nValue iteration:\\n˙ˆP = g\\n\\x10\\nˆA⊤ˆP + ˆP ˆA − ˆPBR−1B⊤ˆP + Q\\n\\x11\\n(21)\\nReference model:\\n˙xm = ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)xm + Bd\\n(22)\\nAdaptive gain dynamics:\\n˙ˆKa = −µB⊤ ˆP(x − xm)x⊤ + B† ˙ˆA\\n(23)\\nSystem input:\\nu = −R−1B⊤ ˆPx + ˆKax + d\\n(24)\\nGiven the two sets C and A0 + Im(B), we are interested in all matrices ˆA ∈ Θ, where\\nΘ := C ∩ (A0 + Im(B))\\n(18)\\nsince they can be used to build reference models.\\nOur controller is conceived as an actor-critic modular architecture where a reference model bridges the\\ntwo parts of the design. The resulting structure is a MRAC where the reference model is continuously\\nupdated with value iteration, thus we aptly name it Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning.\\nWe introduce the building blocks of the design.\\n• Critic: this block performs data-driven value function identification to build an optimal and asymp-\\ntotically stable reference model. In particular, a gradient identifier computes an estimate ˆA ∈ Θ of\\nA that is used to obtain an estimate ˆP of the solution P ⋆ of ARE (6). In this respect, Assumption\\n1 guarantees that for any estimate ˆA the computation of ˆP is feasible. Then, ˆA and the optimal\\ngain estimate −R−1B⊤ ˆP are used to build a reference model having state matrix ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP.\\nAs input to the reference model, we consider a dither d with sufficient richness properties to ensure\\nconvergence to the true system parameters and to the optimal policy.\\n• Actor: this block assigns the input to the plant to adaptively track the reference model. During\\nthe transient, the feedback gain −R−1B⊤ ˆP may be not stabilizing for the real system. For this\\nreason, the actor introduces in the control law an additional adaptive feedback gain ˆKa to cancel the\\nmismatch between the estimated matrix ˆA and the real A. Canceling such a mismatch is possible\\ndue to Assumption 2.\\nSee Fig. 1 for a block scheme of Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning. The full descrip-\\ntion of the design is presented in Algorithm 1 and discussed in detail in the next subsections.\\n8\\nA. Critic: Value Function Identifier\\nIn this subsection, we build a continuous-time identifier of P ⋆ based on the estimation of matrix A.\\nGiven the structure of system (1), we compute an estimate ˆA ∈ Θ of A by designing a swapping filter of\\nthe form (19), with λ > 0 a scalar gain for tuning the filter time constant. Using the filter states, define\\nthe prediction error\\nϵ := ˆAξ − (x + ζ),\\n(25)\\nwhich we can rewrite as ϵ = ( ˆA − A)ξ + ˜ϵ, where\\n˜ϵ := Aξ − (x + ζ),\\n(26)\\nis an error signal that is shown in Section V to converge exponentially to zero. Since the available signal ϵ\\nconverges exponentially to ( ˆA−A)ξ, which contains the parameter estimation error ˆA−A, we can use the\\nnormalized projected gradient descent algorithm (20) to update the estimate ˆA. In (20), parameters γ > 0\\nand ν > 0 are scalar gains, while the multiplicative term BB† is a projection onto Im(B) [39, Sec. 5.5.4].\\nThis projection is needed to ensure, given any initialization ˆA(0) ∈ A0 + Im(B), that the estimate ˆA(t)\\nnever leaves this subspace. Finally, Proj ˆ\\nA∈C{·} is a Lipschitz continuous parameter projection operator,\\nwhose expression is provided, e.g., in [40, Appendix E] and depends on the shape of the set C.\\nGiven the estimate ˆA, we are interested in computing the matrix ˆP ∈ Sn\\n+ that solves the ARE\\nR(P, ˆA) := ˆA⊤P + P ˆA − PBR−1B⊤P + Q = 0.\\n(27)\\nFrom [1], such a matrix could be obtained by computing the map P( ˆA) that solves (27) for each ˆA, i.e.,\\nsuch that:\\nR(P( ˆA), ˆA) = 0,\\nfor all ˆA ∈ Θ.\\n(28)\\nFor simplicity in the implementation and inspired by [29], in Algorithm 1, we compute ˆP via the dynamical\\nsystem (21), which is a DRE rescaled by the tuning gain g > 0. Notice that, if ˆA is constant, then the\\nsolution ˆP of (21) converges to P( ˆA).\\nRemark 6. Assumption 1 guarantees that, for each ˆA ∈ Θ, P( ˆA) exists, is unique, and positive definite\\nfor any ˆA ∈ Θ. Although stabilizability of ( ˆA, B) would be sufficient in Assumption 1 for the solvability\\nof R(P, ˆA) = 0, controllability is essential to guarantee convergence of the identifier under sufficient\\nrichness of the dither d. Moreover, we need observability instead of simple detectability to ensure that\\nP( ˆA) is positive definite.\\nRemark 7. From Assumption 1 and the parameter projection in (20), matrix ˆA−BR−1B⊤P( ˆA) is Hurwitz\\nby design. Therefore, if ˆA converges to a constant matrix, (21) ensures that ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP converges to\\na Hurwitz matrix.\\nB. Reference Model\\nGiven the estimate ˆP of P ⋆, we design a reference model for system (1). The reference model has to\\nembed all the properties required for the plant, i.e., robust stability, optimality and persistency of excitation.\\nTo these aims, consider system (22), where xm ∈ Rn is the reference model state. We embed the stability\\nand optimality properties through ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP, which is designed to converge to a Hurwitz matrix.\\nRemark 8. Different from classic MRAC, the state matrix ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP of the reference model (22) is\\nnot constant but time-varying as it depends on the estimates ˆA and ˆP. This property leads to an adaptive\\ndesign where the known-plant stabilizing gains are time-varying.\\nFinally, we embed the persistency of excitation properties through dither d ∈ Rm, which is chosen such\\nthat it is a bounded stationary signal, whose entries are sufficiently rich of order n + 1 and uncorrelated.\\nRemark 9. We model d(t) as the output of an exosystem of the form (11). It is not necessary to actually\\nimplement the exosystem as part of the algorithm, as we show in the numerical example.\\n9\\nC. Actor: Model Reference Adaptive Controller\\nGiven the reference model (22), we design an adaptive controller for system (1). Define the tracking\\nerror e := x − xm and compute its time derivative from (1), (22) as\\n˙e = Ax + Bu − ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)(x − e) − Bd\\n= ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)e + (A − ˆA)x + B(u + R−1B⊤ ˆPx − d).\\n(29)\\nTo ensure that the plant (1) asymptotically copies the behavior of the reference model (22), i.e., e(t) → 0,\\nwe exploit the fact that ˆA ∈ Θ. In particular, from (17), for each ˆA there exists Ka( ˆA) ∈ Rm×n such that\\nˆA − A = BKa( ˆA).\\n(30)\\nMore specifically, we can ensure that map Ka( ˆA) is smooth in ˆA by choosing:\\nKa( ˆA) := B†( ˆA − A),\\n(31)\\nwhere B† denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of B. This way, (29) becomes\\n˙e = ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)e + B(u + R−1B⊤ ˆPx − Ka( ˆA)x − d),\\n(32)\\nsuggesting a control law of the form\\nu := −R−1B⊤ ˆPx + Ka( ˆA)x + d\\n(33)\\nif the plant dynamics were known. However, Ka( ˆA) is unavailable for design as it depends also on A,\\nas highlighted in (30), thus we consider the certainty-equivalence-based adaptive controller given in (24),\\nwhere Ka( ˆA) is replaced by the adaptive gain ˆKa, driven by the adaptive law (23) where µ > 0 is a scalar\\ngain. The first term in the adaptive law (23) is a standard update to ensure the error e goes asymptotically\\nto zero in a framework where the model mismatch is constant. However, since ˆA is continuously updated\\nby identifier (20), the second term in the update law takes into account the time-varying mismatch.\\nIV. MAIN RESULT\\nWe now provide the main results of this work, where we show that Model Reference Adaptive\\nReinforcement Learning solves the robustly stable on-policy data-driven LQR problem as per Definition\\n1. The first result is given supposing to have a DRE dynamics in (21) infinitely faster than the rest of the\\nsystem (reduced-order system), i.e., supposing ˆP(t) = P(A(t)) as in (28) at each t. For this reason, we\\nmark the results for the reduced-order system with a subscript s to highlight its slow dynamics. We then\\nfollow a singular perturbation approach to prove also Algorithm 1 solves the robustly stable on-policy\\ndata-driven LQR problem.\\nA. Stability Result for the Reduced-Order System\\nConsider the Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning with ARE implementation of ˆP as\\nin (28). Following the notation of Section II, the controller obtained by combining the value function\\nidentifier (19), (20), (28), reference model (22), and the adaptive stabilizer (23), (24) is in the form (9),\\nwith state\\nzs := (ξ, ζ, ˆA, xm, ˆKa) ∈ Zs := R2n × Θ × Rn × Rm×n,\\n(34)\\nand output policy\\nπ(x, zs, d) := ( ˆKa − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA))x + d,\\n(35)\\nfrom which it follows that the learning set L in (10) is non-empty and given by\\nLs := {zs ∈ Zs : ˆKa − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA) = −BR−1B⊤P ⋆}.\\n(36)\\n10\\nIn particular, we recall that our algorithm aims at reaching the learning set by ensuring ˆA → A (hence\\nˆP ≡ P( ˆA) → P ⋆ by continuity of the map P( ˆA)) and ˆKa → 0. The following result shows that, with\\nγ > 0 sufficiently small, the Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning with ARE implementation\\nof ˆP solves the robustly stable on-policy data-driven LQR problem.\\nTheorem 1. Consider the closed-loop system given by the interconnection of plant (1) and the controller\\nof Algorithm 1, with ˆP(t) = P( ˆA(t)) for all t and P( ˆA) satisfying (28). Let the stationary dither d be\\ngenerated by an exosystem of the form (11) and let its entries be sufficiently rich of order n + 1 and\\nuncorrelated. Then, there exists γ⋆ > 0 such that, for all γ ∈ (0, γ⋆], there exists a compact set As\\nsatisfying\\nAs ⊂ {(w, x, zs) ∈ W × Rn × Ls : ˆA = A, ˆKa = 0, x = xm, ϵ = 0}\\n(37)\\nthat is uniformly globally asymptotically stable.\\nB. Stability Result for MR-ARL\\nConsider the Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (MR-ARL) algorithm with DRE\\nimplementation of ˆP as in (21) (Algorithm 1). Following the notation of Section II, the controller obtained\\nby combining the value function identifier (19), (20), (21), reference model (22), and the adaptive stabilizer\\n(23), (24) is in the form (9), with state\\nz := (zs, ˆP) ∈ Z := Zs × Sn\\n0 ,\\n(38)\\nwhere zs and Zs are given in (34). The output policy then becomes\\nπ(x, z, d) := ( ˆKa − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)x + d,\\n(39)\\nand the learning set L is given by\\nL := {z ∈ Z : ˆKa − BR−1B⊤ ˆP = −BR−1B⊤P ⋆}.\\n(40)\\nIn this case, the learning set is reached via ˆA → A (hence ˆP → P ⋆ by asymptotic stability of the DRE\\n(8)) and ˆKa → 0. The next result, which is the main result of this work, shows that with γ > 0 sufficiently\\nsmall and g > 0 sufficiently large, the Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning in Algorithm\\n1 solves the robustly stable on-policy data-driven LQR problem.\\nTheorem 2. Consider the closed-loop system given by the interconnection of plant (1) and the controller\\nof Algorithm 1. Pick d and γ as in Theorem 1. Then, the compact set\\nA:=As × P ⋆ ⊂ {(w, x, z) ∈ W × Rn × L : ˆA = A, ˆKa = 0, x = xm, ϵ = 0, P = P ⋆}\\n(41)\\nis semiglobally uniformly asymptotically stable in the tuning parameter g > 0, where As is given in (37)\\nand g is the one in (21). Namely, for any compact set K ⊂ W × Rn × Z of initial conditions for the\\nclosed-loop system, there exists g > 0 such that A is uniformly asymptotically stable with domain of\\nattraction containing K.\\nV. ALGORITHM ANALYSIS\\nIn the following, we will only study the properties of the reduced-order version of the algorithm, i.e.,\\nwith ˆP(t) = P(A(t)) for all t and P( ˆA) satisfying (28). The second result, i.e., the stability of Algorithm 1\\n(implementing the DRE), is obtained by invoking singular perturbations techniques.\\nA. Error Dynamics\\nWe begin the analysis by presenting the closed-loop dynamics in error coordinates, which is used to\\nprovide the technical results of the following subsections.\\n11\\n1) Identifier Dynamics: Consider the error coordinate ˜ϵ in (26), which can be written as\\n˜ϵ := Aξ − (x + ζ).\\n(42)\\nThen, from (1), (19), it holds that\\n˙˜ϵ = A(−λξ + x) − (Ax + Bu − λ(x + ζ) − Bu)\\n= −λ(Aξ − (x + ζ)) = −λ˜ϵ,\\n(43)\\nwhich ensures that the prediction error ϵ := ˆAξ − (x + ζ) = ( ˆA − A)ξ + ˜ϵ converges to ( ˆA − A)ξ\\nexponentially.\\nDefine ˜A := ˆA − A. Then, from (26), (43), we can rewrite the identifier dynamics (19), (20), (25) in\\nerror coordinates as the following cascaded system\\n˙˜ϵ = −λ˜ϵ\\n˙˜A =Proj\\nˆ\\nA∈C\\n(\\n−γBB† ˜Aξξ⊤ + ˜ϵξ⊤\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n)\\n,\\n(44)\\ndriven by ξ(t), solution of the filter\\n˙ξ = −λξ + x.\\n(45)\\nRemark 10. To ensure ˆA(t) → A, it is known from the adaptive control literature that vector ξ(t) must\\nbe a persistently exciting (PE) signal [31]. However, notice that ξ(t) is a filtered version of x(t), which\\nis generated in closed-loop by interconnecting the plant and the controller. For this reason, special care\\nwill be dedicated to its analysis.\\n2) Reference Model Dynamics: From (28), when ˆP = P( ˆA), system (22) can be written highlighting\\nthe dependence on the estimate ˆA of the identifier:\\n˙xm = ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA))xm + Bd,\\n(46)\\nwhere from (20), (28), the pointwise-in-time value of P( ˆA) is provided implicitly as the solution of a\\nparameter-varying ARE. By [41, Thm. 4.1], P( ˆA) is an analytic function of ˆA, being all matrices of ARE\\nR(P, ˆA) = 0 in (27) analytic functions of ˆA ∈ Θ. From this fact, matrix ˆA − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA) is Hurwitz\\nand an analytic function of ˆA.\\n3) Adaptive Tracking Dynamics: We conclude this overview by studying the interconnection of the error\\ndynamics (32) and the adaptive controller (23), (24). We define ˜Ka := ˆKa − Ka( ˆA). By choosing (24) as\\ninput for (29), we obtain:\\n˙e = ( ˆA − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA))e + B( ˆKax − K( ˆA)x)\\n(47)\\nBy choosing expression (31) for Ka( ˆA), we can explicitly calculate the variation in time of Ka( ˆA) due\\nto the movement of ˆA. This is out of the standard framework of model reference adaptive control, and\\nthus particular attention is required. We can calculate the time derivative of Ka( ˆA) by deriving (31):\\n˙Ka = B† ˙ˆA.\\n(48)\\nSince both B and ˙ˆA are known, we can use their knowledge to implement adaptive law (23), which takes\\ninto account this drift. Given equations (23) and (48), the induced dynamics for ˜Ka is:\\n˙˜Ka = ˙ˆKa − ˙Ka\\n= −µB⊤P( ˆA)(x − xm)x⊤ + B† ˙ˆA − B† ˙ˆA\\n= −µB⊤P( ˆA)ex⊤.\\n(49)\\n12\\nB. Global Boundedness of Solutions\\nWe now show boundedness and forward completeness of the solutions of the closed-loop system\\nobtained from the interconnection of the identifier dynamics (44), (45), the reference model (46), and\\nthe adaptive error system (47), (49). The overall analysis entails proving uniform bounds on the solutions\\nof the main involved subsystems, then combining the results using arguments similar to [40, Thm. 6.3]\\n(see the proof of Proposition 1). To increase readability, we leave the proofs of the technical lemmas in\\nthe Appendix.\\nWe begin by showing uniform boundedness of ˆA and ˙ˆA.\\nLemma 1. Let the maximal interval of solutions of (44), (45), (46), (47), (49) be [0, tf). Then, it holds\\nthat\\nI ) ˜ϵ(·), ˜A(·) are uniformly bounded in the interval [0, tf)\\nII ) ˆA(t) ∈ Θ for all t ∈ [0, tf)\\nFurthermore, if tf = ∞, the origin (˜ϵ, ˜A) = 0 of system (44), driven by input ξ(t), is uniformly globally\\nstable (UGS).\\nLemma 2. Let the maximal interval of solutions of (44), (45), (46), (47), (49) be [0, tf). Then, it holds\\nthat\\n| ˙ˆA(t)| ≤ γ,\\n∀t ∈ [0, tf).\\n(50)\\nRemark 11. The above results hold even if the input ξ(t) of the identifier escapes to infinity as t → tf.\\nAlthough the overall boundedness analysis entails also the study of ξ(t), system (45) ISS with respect\\nto input x(t), thus its behavior will be analyzed directly in Proposition 1.\\nThen, we show that the reference model (46) is bounded as long as | ˙ˆA(t)| is sufficiently small.\\nLemma 3. Let the maximal interval of solutions of (44), (45), (46), (47), (49) be [0, tf). There exists\\nγ⋆\\nb > 0 such that, if | ˙ˆA(t)| ≤ γ⋆\\nb for all t ∈ [0, tf), then xm(·) is uniformly bounded over the interval\\n[0, tf). Furthermore, if tf = ∞, then the reference model (46) with input d(t) is input-to-state stable.\\nNext, we provide a statement for system (47), (49).\\nLemma 4. Let the maximal interval of solutions of (44), (45), (46), (47), (49) be [0, tf). Pick γ⋆\\nb > 0\\nfrom Lemma 3 and let | ˙ˆA(t)| ≤ γ⋆\\nb for all t ∈ [0, tf). Then, signals e(·), ˜Ka(·) are uniformly bounded in\\nthe interval [0, tf). Furthermore, if tf = ∞, the origin (e, ˜Ka) = 0 of system (47), (49), with input ˆA(t),\\nis UGS.\\nFinally, we combine the previous results to obtain that solutions are globally bounded and forward\\ncomplete.\\nProposition 1. Consider the closed-loop system obtained from the interconnection of the identifier dy-\\nnamics (44), (45), the reference model (46), and the adaptive error system (47), (49). Pick γ⋆\\nb from Lemma\\n2. If γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nb], then the closed-loop solutions are bounded and forward complete.\\nProof. Suppose that the maximal interval of existence of the solution of (44), (45), (46), (47), and (49) is\\n[0, tf). Then, from Lemma 1, ˜A(·) and ˜ϵ(·) are uniformly bounded. From Lemma 2, | ˙ˆA(·)| is uniformly\\nbounded by γ. Consider any γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nb], then Lemmas 3 and 4 ensure that xm(·), e(·), and ˜Ka(·) are\\nuniformly bounded, thus also ξ(·) is uniformly bounded from (45) and standard ISS results.\\nWe have thus shown that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded, with bounds that do not\\ndepend on tf. By contradiction, we conclude that tf = ∞, thus the solutions are forward complete. Namely,\\nif tf were finite, the solutions would leave any compact set as t → tf, contradicting the independence of\\nthe bounds on tf [40, Thm. 6.3].\\n13\\nC. Exponential Convergence to the Optimal Policy\\nWe now focus on the uniform asymptotic stability properties of the closed-loop system (44), (45), (46),\\n(47), (49). First, we show that xm(t) is persistently exciting as long as | ˙ˆA| is sufficiently small.\\nLemma 5. Let the entries of stationary input d be sufficiently rich of order n+1 and uncorrelated. There\\nexists γ⋆\\nPE ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nb], with γ⋆\\nb from Proposition 1, such that, for all γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nPE], the solutions xm(t) of\\nthe reference model (46) are persistently exciting (PE).\\nNext, we provide a direct consequence of Lemma 5 for the adaptive error dynamics (47), (49).\\nLemma 6. Let the hypotheses of Lemma 5 hold and let γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nPE], where γ⋆\\nPE is given in Lemma 5.\\nThen, the origin (e, ˜Ka) = 0 of system (47), (49) is uniformly globally asymptotically stable (UGAS) and\\nuniformly locally exponentially stable (ULES).\\nNow that we have established that every solution e(t) converges exponentially to zero, uniformly from\\ncompact sets of initial conditions, we can conclude the convergence analysis by studying the identifier\\ndynamics (44).\\nLemma 7. Let the hypotheses of Lemma 5 hold and let γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nPE], where γ⋆\\nPE is given in Lemma\\n5. Then, the origin (˜ϵ, ˜A) = 0 of system (44), with input ξ(t), is uniformly globally exponentially stable\\n(UGES).\\nD. Proof of the Main Results\\n1) Proof of Theorem 1: Pick γ⋆ := min{γ⋆\\nb, γ⋆\\nPE} = γ⋆\\nPE, where γ⋆\\nb is from Proposition 1 and γ⋆\\nPE\\nis the one of Lemma 5. Then, if γ ≤ γ⋆, the closed-loop solutions are bounded and forward complete.\\nMoreover, xm is PE. The remainder of the proof involves showing the existence of a UGAS attractor\\nusing the concept of ω-limit set of a set, see [34, Def. 6.23].\\nBy Lemmas 6 and 7, from any compact set of initial conditions, it holds that ˆA → A, ˜ϵ → 0, e →\\n0, ˜Ka → 0 exponentially. Moreover, by Lemma 3, the model reference subsystem (46) is ISS with\\nuniformly bounded input d(t), in particular we have that:\\n|xm| ≥ Xm =⇒\\n˙Vm ≤ −q\\n4|xm|2,\\n(51)\\nwhere Xm can be found in (88) and depends on ∥d(·)∥∞, and Vm in (80) is an ISS Lyapunov function\\nfor the reference model. Consider the ξ subsystem in (19). It holds that\\n|ξ| ≥ 2|x|\\nλ\\n=⇒\\nd\\ndt\\n\\x121\\n2|ξ|2\\n\\x13\\n≤ −λ\\n2|ξ|2.\\n(52)\\nDenote Ξ := 2\\nλXm and define the compact set\\nK⋆\\ns := {(w, x, zs) ∈ W × Rn × Zs : ˆA = A, ˜ϵ = 0, e = 0, |xm| ≤ Xm, |ξ| ≤ Ξ} ⊂ W × Rn × Ls,\\n(53)\\nwhere Ls is the learning set given in (36). Consider a set of initial conditions Ks := K⋆\\ns + cB, with c > 0\\narbitrary, and note that the solutions are empty if they start outside W × Rn × Zs. We now prove that\\nK⋆\\ns is uniformly attractive from Ks. By the above-mentioned properties for the subsystems ˜A, ˜ϵ, e, ˜Ka, xm,\\nthere exists T ′ > 0 such that, for any ε > 0, it holds that\\n| ˜A(t)| ≤ ε,\\n|˜ϵ(t)| ≤ ε,\\n|e(t)| ≤ min\\n\\x12\\nε, λ\\n2\\nε\\n3\\n\\x13\\n,\\n|xm(t)| ≤ Xm + min\\n\\x12\\nε, λ\\n2\\nε\\n3\\n\\x13\\n.\\n(54)\\nfor all t ≥ T ′, from which it holds also that\\n2|x(t)|\\nλ\\n≤ 2\\nλ(|xm(t)| + |e(t)|)\\n≤ Ξ + ε\\n3 + ε\\n3 ≤ Ξ + 2\\n3ε.\\n(55)\\n14\\nThus, from (52), there exists T ≥ T ′ such that |ξ(t)| ≤ Ξ + ε for all t ≥ T.\\nFor compactness of notation, denote xs := (w, x, zs). The arguments above have proved that K⋆\\ns is\\nuniformly attractive from Ks. Namely, for any ρ > 0, there exists Tρ ≥ 0 such that |ϕ(t, xs)|K⋆s ≤ ρ, for\\nall t ≥ Tρ and xs ∈ Ks, where ϕ(t, xs) is the solution at time t of the closed-loop system having initial\\ncondition xs.\\nDenote with As := Ω(Ks) the ω-limit set of Ks. We want to prove that As ⊂ K⋆\\ns . We do it by\\ncontradiction, i.e., we suppose that As ⊂ K⋆\\ns is false. Under this hypothesis, there exists ¯xs ∈ As and\\nρ > 0 such that |¯xs|K⋆s ≥ 3ρ. By definition [34, Def. 6.23], the ω-limit set of Ks is the set of all points xs\\nsuch that there exist sequences xs,n ∈ Ks, tn ≥ 0 such that limn→∞ tn = ∞ and limn→∞ ϕ(tn, xs,n) = xs.\\nTherefore, by definition of limit, there exists ¯n ∈ N such that\\n|ϕ(tn, xs,n) − ¯xs| ≤ ρ,\\n∀n ≥ ¯n.\\n(56)\\nPick any subsequence xs,ni, tni such that, for ni ≥ ¯n, then tni ≥ Tρ, where Tρ derives from the uniform\\nattractivity of K⋆\\ns (see above). We have thus proved that, for ni ≥ ¯n, |ϕ(tni, xs,ni) − ¯xs| ≤ ρ, thus\\n|ϕ(tni, xs,ni)|K⋆s ≥ 2ρ, and at the same time |ϕ(tni, xs,ni)|K⋆s ≤ ρ by uniform attractivity of K⋆\\ns . This is a\\ncontradiction, hence necessarily As ⊂ K⋆\\ns .\\nTo summarize the previous results, we have thus proved that the solutions are globally bounded and\\nforward complete and\\nAs := Ω(Ks) ⊂ K⋆\\ns ⊂ Int(Ks) ⊂ Ks.\\n(57)\\nBy [34, Corollary 7.7], As = Ω(Ks) is asymptotically stable, with domain of attraction containing Ks.\\nSince Ks can be chosen arbitrarily large due to Proposition 1, we conclude UGAS of As.\\n2) Proof of Theorem 2: Consider the reduced-order system with state xs := (w, x, zs) and the boundary\\nlayer system with state ˆP. Define the indicator functions\\nωs(xs) :=\\n(\\n|xs|As\\nxs ∈ W × Rn × Zs\\n∞\\nelsewhere\\nωf(xs, ˆP) :=\\n(\\n| ˆP − P( ˆA)|\\n(xs, ˆP) ∈ W × Rn × Z\\n∞\\nelsewhere.\\n(58)\\nBy Theorem 1, the reduced-order system satisfies\\nωs(xs(t)) ≤ βs(ωs(xs(0)), t),\\n(59)\\nwhere βs is a class KL function. Moreover, by the DRE properties [37, Thm. 4], the boundary-layer\\nsystem d ˆP/dτ(τ) = R( ˆP(τ), ˆA), with ˆA ∈ Θ constant and τ := gt, satisfies\\nωf(xs, ˆP(τ)) ≤ βf(ωf(xs, ˆP(0)), τ),\\n(60)\\nwhere βf is a class KL function. From [42, Thm. 1] (Assumptions 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 can be verified), from any\\ncompact set of initial conditions K ⊂ W × Rn × Z and for any δ > 0, there exists g⋆ > 0 such that, for\\nall g ≥ g⋆, the solutions are forward complete and satisfy:\\nωs(xs(t)) ≤ βs(ωs(xs(0)), t) + δ\\nωf(xs(t), ˆP(t)) ≤ βf(ωf(xs(0), ˆP(0)), gt) + δ.\\n(61)\\nIn particular, choose K := As × P ⋆ + cB, with c > 0 arbitrary. Reference model dynamics (22) can be\\nrewritten as:\\n˙xm =( ˆA − BR−1B⊤ ˆP)xm + Bd\\n=(A − BR−1B⊤P ⋆)xm + Bd + ( ˜A − BR−1B⊤( ˆP − P ⋆))xm\\n=(A − BR−1B⊤P ⋆)xm + Bd + ( ˜A − BR−1B⊤( ˆP − P( ˆA) + P( ˆA) − P(A)))xm.\\n(62)\\n15\\nNotice that xm is PE if ˆP = P( ˆA) and ˜A = 0. Furthermore, since P( ˆA) is an analytic function of ˆA, xm\\nis PE by [43, Lemma 6.1.2] if | ˆP − P( ˆA)| and | ˜A| are sufficiently small, because the solutions of (62)\\nare sufficiently close to those with ˆP = P( ˆA) and ˜A = 0. Moreover, also x and ξ are PE if xm is PE and\\n|e| is sufficiently small. Choose δ > 0 such that the conditions ωs(xs) ≤ 2δ and ωf(xs, ˆP) ≤ 2δ imply\\nthat xm, x, and ξ are PE. Then, pick g ≥ g⋆, where g⋆ is obtained from the considered K and δ. From\\n(61), the closed-loop solutions converge in finite time T to a compact set satisfying ωs(xs) ≤ 2δ and\\nωf(xs, ˆP) ≤ 2δ. Then, for t ≥ T, ˜ϵ → 0, ˆA → A exponentially from Lemma 7 since ξ is PE. From the\\nlocal exponential stability of the DRE [37, Thm. 4], it follows that ˆP → P ⋆ exponentially. By Lemma 6\\nand ˆP → P( ˆA), we conclude that e → 0, ˆKa → 0 exponentially. As a consequence, the same arguments\\nof Theorem 1 (omitted here to avoid repetition) can be used to show that the compact set\\nK⋆ := {(xs, ˆP) ∈ W × Rn × Z : ˆA = A, ˜ϵ = 0, e = 0, |xm| ≤ Xm, |ξ| ≤ Ξ, ˆP = P ⋆}\\n= K⋆\\ns × P ⋆,\\n(63)\\nis uniformly attractive from K, with K⋆\\ns given in (53) . The same steps as in Theorem 1 allow to prove\\nthat A := Ω(K) ⊂ K⋆ ⊂ Int(K) ⊂ K, thus A is uniformly asymptotically stable with domain of attraction\\ncontaining K, and since K can be chosen arbitrarily large we can conclude semiglobal uniform asymptotic\\nstability of A.\\nFinally, we want to prove that A = As × P ⋆, where As = Ω(K⋆\\ns). In A, it holds that ˆP = P ⋆, ˆA = A\\nand ˜ϵ = 0, from which it holds that ˆP = P( ˆA) = P(A) = P ⋆ for all points in this set. For this reason,\\nin A, the vector field of Algorithm 1 coincides with the vector field of the reduced-order system with\\nˆA = A and ˜ϵ = 0. Since the vector fields coincide, we have that in this set solutions x(t) of Algorithm 1\\ncan be written as x(t) = xs(t) × P ⋆, where xs(t) is the solution of the reduced-order system having the\\nsame initial conditions.\\nFrom (63) and A ⊂ K⋆, it follows that A = Ω(K) = Ω(K⋆) = Ω(K⋆\\ns × P ⋆) = A′ × P ⋆. Since for the\\nslow states of Algorithm 1 the solutions coincide with those of the reduced-order system, it follows that\\nA′ = As. As a consequence, A = As × P ⋆.\\nVI. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS: CONTROL OF A DOUBLY FED INDUCTION MOTOR\\nIn this section, we propose two numerical examples to show the effectiveness of Model Reference\\nAdaptive Reinforcement Learning. In the first example, we consider the model of a doubly fed induction\\nmotor (DFIM) at constant speed with unknown rotor and stator resistances. In the second example, we\\ntest the robustness of the proposed algorithm by considering a DFIM with slowly time-varying unknown\\nresistances, due to the motor heating up, and rotor acceleration.\\nA. Example 1: Constant Parameters\\nA DFIM at constant speed can be modeled [44] with a linear system in the form of (1) with state\\nx = (i1u, i1v, i2u, i2v) ∈ R4,\\n(64)\\nwhere i1u, i1v are the stator currents and i2u, i2v are the rotor currents. The input is\\nu = (u1u, u1v, u2u, u2v) ∈ R4,\\n(65)\\nwhere u1u, u1v are the stator voltages and u2u, u2v, the rotor voltages.

Finally, ωr and ω0 are the electrical angular speeds\\nof the rotor and the rotating reference frame, which we suppose constant.\\nRemark 12. We suppose to have uncertainties on the parameters R1 and R2. This makes the matrix A\\nuncertain in half of its entries. In this example B is such that Im(B) = Rn×n, so Assumption 2 is fulfilled\\nfor any A0 ∈ Rn×n.\\nDenote the true resistances as R1, R2. We model our uncertainties specifying nominal values ¯R1, ¯R2\\nand radiuses r1, r2 > 0 such that\\nR1 ∈ [ ¯R1 − r1, ¯R1 + r1]\\nR2 ∈ [ ¯R2 − r2, ¯R2 + r2].\\n(68)\\nNext, we define C as a ball about the nominal ¯A (i.e., having the structure (66) with resistances ¯R1 and\\n¯R2) containing all possible parameter variation, i.e.,\\nC := { ˆA ∈ Rn×n : | ˆA − ¯A|F ≤ ρ}\\n(69)\\nwith ρ > 0 big enough.

Next, in Fig. 2-(b), we show how the error\\nbetween the optimal feedback gain K⋆ and the overall applied feedback gain −R−1B⊤ ˆP + ˆKa approaches\\nzero, thus controlling in an optimal way the system. In Fig. 3, we show for completeness the error between\\nthe reference model and the real system, which reaches a small amplitude in a few seconds.\\n17\\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n0\\n0.5\\n1\\n1.5\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n0\\n0.5\\n1\\n1.5\\nFig. 2.

We model both disturbances with sigmoid functions and we report them in the plots.\\nThe temperature disturbance lasts for about 600 s and brings the temperature from 20 ◦C to 100 ◦C, i.e.,\\n∆T = 80 ◦C. The speed disturbance is a total increase of speed of 2π20 rad/s occurring in about 60 s.\\n18\\nTABLE IV\\nUNCERTAINTY PARAMETERS FOR EXAMPLE 2.\\nParameter\\nValue\\nParameter\\nValue\\n¯R1 [Ω]\\n0.2\\nr1 [Ω]\\n0.18\\n¯R2 [Ω]\\n0.2\\nr2 [Ω]\\n0.18\\n¯ωr [rad/s]\\n2π70\\nrω [rad/s]\\n2π15\\nρ\\n4830\\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n0\\n1000\\n2000\\n3000\\n4000\\n5000\\n6000\\n0\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\n500\\n600\\ntemperature variation [°C]\\nspeed variation [rad/s]\\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\n500\\n600\\ntemperature variation [°C]\\nspeed variation [rad/s]\\nFig. 4.

We recalculate C as in the previous example. Finally, we leave the dither as in (70).\\nRemark 13. Due to the parameter variations, the plant becomes a slowly time-varying system. Consistently\\nwith the theoretical result, due to the “small” variations, the stability properties of Theorem 2 are\\npractically preserved and recovered when the variations vanish.\\nIn Fig. 4-(a), we show the difference between the estimate ˆA(t) and the true time-varying matrix A(t).\\nNotice that as soon as the speed disturbance ends, the gradient estimator is able to adapt and recover\\nconvergence of the estimation to a small ball about the true parameters. Next, in Fig. 4-(b), we show how\\nthe data-driven feedback gain approaches the optimal one. Since in this simulation we have a LTV plant,\\nwe calculate at each time instant the optimal gain K⋆(t) by solving an LQR problem with constant A(t).\\nThe importance of the adaptive controller action is particularly clear in presence of the speed disturbance,\\nwhere the estimated matrix is far from the true one and thus the optimal action is likely to be destabilizing.\\nFinally, we show in Fig. 5 how the error between the reference model and the real plant is kept bounded\\nalso in the presence of these disturbances.\\n19\\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n-6\\n-4\\n-2\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\nFig. 5.

CONCLUSIONS\\nIn this paper, we have addressed the problem of data-driven optimal control of partially unknown linear\\nsystems. First, we have proposed a framework that formalizes a robustlty stable on-policy data-driven\\nLQR problem in which optimality of the learned strategy is obtained while guaranteeing robust stability\\nof the whole learning and control closed-loop system. Next, we have proposed a new solution to this\\nproblem consisting in the combination of model reference adaptive control and reinforcement learning.\\nAs main result, we showed that our design has a semiglobally uniformly asymptotically stable attractor\\nwhere the plant follows the optimal reference model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution, we\\ntested it in the control of a doubly fed induction motor. The results show that our solution is also able to\\nmanage non-vanishing perturbations typical of real-world applications.\\nVIII. APPENDIX\\nA. Proofs\\nProof of Lemma 1. At first, to simplify the expressions for the Lyapunov function, we introduce the\\nfollowing vectorized coordinates:\\nˆθA := vec( ˆA) ∈ Rn2,\\n˜θA := vec( ˜A) ∈ Rn2.\\n(72)\\nIt can be verified the following relation holds:\\nvec(BB†ϵξ⊤) = ¯B(ξ ⊗ In)ϵ,\\n¯B := (In ⊗ BB†),\\n(73)\\nwhere ¯B defines a projection onto Im(In ⊗B) ⊂ Rn2. Notice that, for any ˆθA ∈ Im(In ⊗B) and τ ∈ Rn2,\\nthen ˜θA ∈ Im(In ⊗ B) and, since the scalar product of orthogonal vectors is zero and by idempotence of\\nthe projection,\\n˜θ⊤\\nAτ = ˜θ⊤\\nA(τ∥ + τ⊥) = ˜θ⊤\\nAτ∥ + 0 = ˜θ⊤\\nA ¯Bτ∥ = ˜θ⊤\\nA ¯B(τ∥ + τ⊥) = ˜θ⊤\\nA ¯Bτ,\\n(74)\\nwhere τ∥ ∈ Im(In ⊗ B) and τ⊥ ∈ (In ⊗ B)⊥. We rewrite (20) by using the vectorized coordinates defined\\nabove:\\n˙ˆθA =\\nProj\\nvec−1 ˆθA∈C\\n\\x1a\\n−γ ¯B (ξ ⊗ In)ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n\\x1b\\n.\\n(75)\\nThe computations from here are similar to [40, Lemma 6.1] but we report them for the reader’s conve-\\nnience. Define\\nVA(˜ϵ, ˜θA) := 1\\nλ|˜ϵ|2 + 1\\n2γ |˜θA|2,\\n(76)\\n20\\nwhich is positive definite with respect to (0, 0) and radially unbounded. Note that ϵ = (ξ ⊗ In)⊤˜θA + ˜ϵ.\\nThen, using (74) and [40, Lemma E.1] to treat the projection operator Proj ˆ\\nA∈C{·}, the derivative of VA\\nalong the solutions of (44) is\\n˙VA = −2|˜ϵ|2 + ˜θ⊤\\nA\\nProj\\nvec−1 ˆθA∈C\\n\\x1a\\n− ¯B (ξ ⊗ In)ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n\\x1b\\n≤ −2|˜ϵ|2 −\\n˜θ⊤\\nA ¯B(ξ ⊗ In)ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n= −2|˜ϵ|2 −\\n˜θ⊤\\nA(ξ ⊗ In)ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ|\\n≤ −2|˜ϵ|2 − |ϵ|2 − ˜ϵ⊤ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ|2\\n≤ −2|˜ϵ|2 − 1\\n4\\n|ϵ|2\\n(1 + ν|ξ|2)2 +\\n˜ϵ⊤ϵ\\n1 + ν|ξ|2 − 3\\n4\\n|ϵ|2\\n1 + ν|ξ|2\\n= −|˜ϵ|2 −\\n\\x121\\n2\\n|ϵ|\\n1 + ν|ξ|2 − ˜ϵ\\n\\x132\\n− 3\\n4\\n|ϵ|2\\n1 + ν|ξ|2 ≤ 0\\n(77)\\nimplying that (˜ϵ(t), ˜θA(t)) is contained for all t ∈ [0, tf) in a compact sublevel set of VA. We conclude\\nthe proof by recalling [40, Lemma E.1] to ensure ˆA(t) ∈ Θ, for all its domain of existence.\\nProof of Lemma 2. Using [40, Lemma E.1] to treat the projection operator Proj ˆ\\nA∈C{·} and the fact that\\n| ¯B| = 1 due to (73), we can bound | ˙ˆA| as follows:\\n| ˙ˆA| ≤ | ˙ˆA|F = | ˙ˆθA| ≤ γ| ¯B||(ξ ⊗ In)||ϵ|\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ| ≤\\nγ|ξ||ϵ|\\n1 + ν|ξ||ϵ| ≤ γ.\\n(78)\\nProof of Lemma 3. Function P( ˆA) being continuous and Θ a compact set, there exist scalars pmin, pmax > 0\\nsuch that\\npminIn ≤ P( ˆA) ≤ pmaxIn,\\n∀ ˆA ∈ Θ.\\n(79)\\nThen, define the Lyapunov function\\nVm(xm, t) := xm\\n⊤P( ˆA)xm\\n(80)\\nwhich is positive definite and radially unbounded, and whose derivative along the solutions of (22) is\\ngiven by:\\n˙Vm = xm\\n⊤ \\x10\\nP( ˆA)Acl( ˆA) +Acl( ˆA)\\n⊤P( ˆA)\\n\\x11\\nxm + xm\\n⊤\\n \\n∂P( ˆA)\\n∂ ˆA\\n⊙ ˙ˆA\\n!\\nxm + 2xm\\n⊤P( ˆA)Bd,\\n(81)\\nwhere\\nAcl( ˆA) := ˆA − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA)\\n(82)\\nand the product ⊙ is defined as\\n∂P( ˆA)\\n∂ ˆA\\n⊙ ˙ˆA =\\nn\\nX\\ni=1\\nn\\nX\\nj=1\\n∂P( ˆA)\\n∂[ ˆA]ij\\n[ ˙ˆA]ij,\\n(83)\\nwith [ ˆA]ij the i-th row and j-th column entry of matrix ˆA. Since ˆP = P( ˆA) solves at each time instant\\nARE (27), it holds that:\\nAcl( ˆA)P( ˆA)+P( ˆA)Acl( ˆA) =−Q−K( ˆA)\\n⊤RK( ˆA)\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\n=:− ¯Q( ˆ\\nA)\\n,\\n(84)\\n21\\nwhere from Assumption 1 and Θ being compact, ¯Q( ˆA) ≥ q > 0 for all ˆA ∈ Θ, with q defined as\\nq := min\\nˆ\\nA∈Θ λmin\\n\\x10\\n−Q − P( ˆA)BRB⊤P( ˆA)\\n\\x11\\n,\\n(85)\\nwhere λmin(·) denotes the smallest eigenvalue of a matrix.

At first, to simplify the expressions for the Lyapunov function, we introduce the\\nfollowing vectorized coordinates:\\nˆθa := vec( ˆKa) ∈ Rmn,\\n˜θa := vec( ˜Ka) ∈ Rmn.\\n(89)\\nWe rewrite dynamics (47) and (49) by using the vectorized coordinates above defined:\\n˙e = Acl( ˆA)e + B ˆKax − BKa( ˆA)x\\n= Acl( ˆA)e + B(x ⊗ Im)⊤˜θa,\\n˙˜θa = −µ(x ⊗ Im)B⊤P( ˆA)e.\\n(90)\\nConsider the Lyapunov function\\nVe(e, ˜θa, t) := e⊤P( ˆA)e + 1\\nµ|˜θa|2,\\n(91)\\nwhich is positive definite and radially unbounded. The time derivative of Ve along the trajectories of (90)\\nis given by\\n˙Ve = e⊤\\n \\nP( ˆA)Acl( ˆA) + Acl( ˆA)\\n⊤P( ˆA) + ∂P( ˆA)\\n∂ ˆA\\n⊙ ˙ˆA\\n!\\ne\\n+ 2e⊤P( ˆA)B(x ⊗ Im)⊤˜θa − 2\\nµ\\n˜θ⊤\\na (µ(x ⊗ Im)B⊤P( ˆA)e)\\n= − e⊤\\n \\n¯Q( ˆA) − ∂P( ˆA)\\n∂ ˆA\\n⊙ ˙ˆA\\n!\\ne ≤ −q\\n2|e|2 ≤ 0,\\n(92)\\n22\\nwhere Acl( ˆA) is defined in (82), ¯Q( ˆA) is given in (84), and q is found in (85). We have ensured that\\n(e(t), ˜θa(t)) is contained for all t ∈ [0, tf) in a compact sublevel set of Ve, thus concluding the proof.\\nProof of Lemma 5. For all ˆA ∈ Θ, pair (Acl( ˆA), B) in (46), with Acl( ˆA) given in (82), is controllable\\nbecause ( ˆA, B) is controllable from Assumption (1). Additionally, the origin of system ˙xm = Acl( ˆA)xm\\nis UGES from Lemma 3.\\nFrom classical results on PE [31, §5.6.4], if ˙ˆA = 0 then xm(t) is PE, i.e, there exist T > 0, α > 0 such\\nthat\\nZ t+T\\nt\\nxm(s)xm(s)⊤ds ≥ αIn,\\n∀t ≥ 0.\\n(93)\\nBy [45, Thm. 6.1], there exist a constant scalar η > 0, such that, if\\n|Acl( ˆA(s)) − Acl( ˆA(τ))| ≤ η,\\n∀s, τ ∈ [t, t + T],\\n(94)\\nfor all t ≥ 0, then xm(t) is PE also when ˙ˆA ̸= 0. Recall that Acl( ˆA) := ˆA − BR−1B⊤P( ˆA) is an analytic\\nfunction of ˆA [41, Thm. 4.1]. Thus, from the mean-value theorem and similar computations to (86), we\\nobtain:\\n|Acl( ˆA(s)) − Acl( ˆA(τ))| =\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c(s − τ)∂Acl( ˆA)\\n∂ ˆA\\n⊙ ˙ˆA(ς)\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n≤ |s − τ|cn\\n3\\n2| ˙ˆA(ς)|,\\n(95)\\nwhere ς ∈ [s, τ], c := maxi,j∈{1,...,n}\\nn\\nmax ˆ\\nA∈Θ\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c ∂Acl( ˆ\\nA)\\n∂[ ˆ\\nA]ij\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\no\\n. From the fact that | ˙ˆA(·)| ≤ γ, we conclude that\\nfor γ⋆\\nPE := η/(Tcn\\n3\\n2), if γ ∈ (0, γ⋆\\nPE], then bound η in (94) is enforced and thus xm(t) is PE.\\nProof of Lemma 6. From Lemma 4 and the solutions being forward complete, it holds that the origin\\n(e, ˜θa) = 0 of system (90) is UGS. Note that the regressor in (49) is given by x(t). Therefore, if x(t) is\\nuniformly PE (u-PE) as in [35, Def. 5], then UGAS and ULES of (e, ˜θa) = 0 follows from [35, Thm. 1\\nand 2]. To prove u-PE of x(t), note that x(t) = xm(t)+e(t), where xm(t) is PE from Lemma 5. Therefore,\\nwe conclude u-PE of x(t) from [35, Prop. 2].\\nProof of Lemma 7. From Lemma 1 and UGES of the ˜ϵ subsystem, we only need to prove UGES of\\nsystem (44) with ˜ϵ = 0, which we write here in vectorized coordinates:\\n˙˜θA =\\nProj\\nvec−1 ˆθA∈C\\n(\\n−γ ¯B (ξ ⊗ In)(ξ ⊗ In)⊤˜θA\\n1 + ν|ξ|| ˜Aξ|\\n)\\n.\\n(96)\\nSince the directions where learning happens are unchanged by the projection operator and by ¯B, we\\nare interested in studying regressor ¯ξ(t) :=\\nξ(t)⊗In\\n√\\n1+ν|ξ(t)|| ˜\\nA(t)ξ(t)| in order to prove our result. Given a small\\nenough gain γ, it holds from Lemma 5 that xm(t) is PE, while e(t) → 0 exponentially fast from Lemma\\n6. From (45), ξ(t) is a filtered version of the PE signal xm(t) + e(t), thus ξ(t) is PE [31, Lemma. 4.8.3].\\nSince all signals are bounded and (ξ ⊗ In)(ξ ⊗ In)⊤ = (ξξ⊤) ⊗ In, PE of ξ(t) implies that\\nZ t+T\\nt\\n¯ξ(s)¯ξ(s)⊤ds ≥\\nZ t+T\\nt\\n(ξ(s)ξ(s)⊤) ⊗ In\\n1 + ξ2\\nM ˜AM\\nds ≥ αIn2,\\n(97)\\nfor some T, α > 0 and all t ∈ R≥0, with ξM := supt∈R |ξ(t)|, ˜AM := supt∈R | ˜A(t)|, thus ¯ξ(t) is PE. From\\n[31, Thm. 8.5.6], we conclude that ˜A = 0 is UGES.\\n23\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] M. Borghesi, A. Bosso, and G.

First, we introduce a reinforcement learning paradigm\\nfor on-policy data-driven LQR, where exploration and exploitation are\\nsimultaneously performed while guaranteeing robust stability of the whole\\nclosed-loop system encompassing the plant and the control/learning dynamics.\\nThen, we propose Model Reference Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (MR-ARL), a\\ncontrol architecture integrating tools from reinforcement learning and model\\nreference adaptive control. The approach stands on a variable reference model\\ncontaining the currently identified value function. Then, an adaptive\\nstabilizer is used to ensure convergence of the applied policy to the optimal\\none, convergence of the plant to the optimal reference model, and overall\\nrobust closed-loop stability. The proposed framework provides theoretical\\nrobustness certificates against real-world perturbations such as measurement\\nnoise, plant nonlinearities, or slowly varying parameters. The effectiveness of\\nthe proposed architecture is validated via realistic numerical simulations.'})"

      "Based on the content provided, here are some critical issues in the paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lack of Clarity in the Presentation: The paper lacks clarity in explaining the proposed MR-ARL framework. The description of the framework is vague and can be difficult to understand for readers who are not well-versed in the subject matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Theoretical Robustness Certificates: The paper claims to provide theoretical robustness certificates against real-world perturbations, but it does not provide sufficient details or evidence to support this claim. It is important to provide a clear and detailed explanation of how these certificates are derived and validated.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Limited Discussion on Implementation: The paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of the proposed framework but lacks discussion on the practical implementation challenges. It would be valuable to include a section discussing potential implementation issues and how they can be addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Validation Methodology: While the paper mentions the validation of the proposed architecture through realistic numerical simulations, it does not provide enough information on the simulation setup, metrics used for evaluation, or comparison with existing approaches. A more detailed description of the validation methodology would strengthen the credibility of the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Lack of Empirical Results: The paper mentions the effectiveness of the proposed architecture is validated through numerical simulations, but it does not provide any empirical results or analysis of the simulation outcomes. Including empirical results and a thorough analysis would enhance the credibility of the proposed framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. References and Related Work: The paper lacks a comprehensive review of related work and references to existing literature in the field of data-driven LQR design and reinforcement learning. Providing a stronger foundation by referencing relevant works would support the novelty and contribution of the proposed framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the paper would benefit from improving the clarity of presentation, providing more detailed explanations of theoretical concepts, discussing implementation challenges, strengthening the validation methodology, presenting empirical results, and enhancing the review of related work. Addressing these issues would improve the overall quality and impact of the paper.\n"
